Introduction to automation        Resources     Manual    Introduction to automation   think-cell helps you to quickly create professional, data-driven charts in Power Point. But what about automating periodic reports, or using a web service to create charts based on your parameters, or exporting your business intelligence reports as Power Point slides? Using think-cell’s automation, you can do this quickly with your Excel or JSON data, and without the mistakes commonly found in a manual process. All you need is:  A Power Point presentation with think-cell charts. Programmatic logic to control the automation. Let’s begin by creating a Power Point presentation with a think-cell chart and a text box for the slide title as an automation template:  Create a chart in Power Point as described in 4. Introduction to charting and later chapters. Any think-cell chart type will work, including all decorations like axes and difference arrows. The initial data is not important as it will later be replaced programmatically by the real data. In the contextual toolbar of the chart, click on the field that says Update Chart Name. Enter a unique name, e.g., Chart1, which you will refer to later. Where the slide title should appear on the slide, insert a    Named Text Field from the Elements menu. In the contextual toolbar of the text field, click on the field that says Update Chart Name. Enter a unique name, e.g., Title, which you will refer to later. Save the presentation, e.g., as template.pptx. The next step is to create programmatic logic which will merge your Excel or JSON data with the template slide. With the process above you can create presentations with arbitrary combinations of think-cell charts. You can prepare a library of all the chart types you need and, as required, versions with different chart decorations enabled. Then, you can freely combine these templates and supply them with data for use in a new presentation using either Excel or JSON. Note: This approach replaces the need for a general API to create charts and add chart decorations, which is not supported.Introduction Charting Layout External data Automation Library Appendices Not yet a user?')], 'answer': \" To automate reports using Think-cell, first, create a PowerPoint presentation with a think-cell chart and a text box for the slide title as an automation template.

How to apply the MECE principle to Power Point presentations        Resources     Content hub    How to apply the MECE principle to Power Point presentations    11 min read  — by Akash Choudhary Imagine you are asked to solve a company’s problem to retain employees. It is a complex puzzle for which there are many possible solutions. Should the company change its pay structure? Offer more paid time off? Create a Google-style employee lounge?If you had a list of all potential solutions, would you present each solution one-by-one to the stakeholders? This approach may be overwhelming for your audience, making it challenging for them to comprehend the options and make a decision. Instead, your objective could be to offer an understanding of the available options and recommendations to your audience, likely in the form of a Power Point presentation, that can facilitate the decision-making process. That is where the MECE principle can help. An important component of the famed Pyramid Principle, MECE helps you group ideas logically for better decision-making. This blog is intended to give you an overview of MECE and how to use it to build more compelling Power Point presentations.What is the MECE principle?The principle is used for grouping ideas in a way that covers all options without overlapping. MECE stands for mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. Mutually exclusive means that each option falls into only one category. Collectively exhaustive means each possible option is represented. This ensures that no potential solutions are double-counted and that all possible solutions or approaches to a problem are considered.Businesses often apply this principle in brainstorming sessions, problem solving and project planning exercises to ensure they consider all relevant factors and offer comprehensive and effective solutions. While MECE is applicable to complex problems, its aim is to bring about clarity. Businesses and consultants can use Power Point presentations to guide clients through the complicated processes that enable better business decisions.The origins of the MECE principle Former Mc Kinsey strategy consultant Barbara Minto invented the principle, though she attributes the original idea to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose work on logic and categorization laid the foundation for many analytical principles. MECE is a foundational concept within the Pyramid principle, an organizing framework Minto developed for training consultants on how to structure effective communications.The Pyramid principle, first published in Minto’s 1987 book of the same name, centers on presenting the top-level message first, then laying out supporting arguments and facts. In other words, each higher-level idea is a summary of the points below.What the MECE principle is and is not Steps to applying the MECE principle By following these steps, you can apply MECE effectively and ensure that all possible options for solving a problem are considered in a comprehensive and organized way.Example 1: The MECE principle in everyday practice For an everyday example, imagine you and your partner are trying to decide what movie to see. First, you separate your movie choices into three categories: Movies only one of you has seen Movies both of you have seen Movies neither of you has seen Next, you refine those categories. For example, within the category of movies only one of you has seen, you have two subcategories: Movies only you have seen Movies only your partner has seen In this example, all possible options will fall into one of these groups (collectively exhaustive), and no movie can appear in more than one group (mutually exclusive). MECE: The business context Some instances where businesses use the principle are: How to increase revenue Whether or not to acquire a given company Whether or not to introduce a new product If a new geographic market should be entered Breaking down these questions in a presentation necessarily requires presenting a range of sub questions, assertions or options. The problem is that a long list is harder for your audience to digest and remember. By breaking questions into MECE groupings, you can ensure your message is laid out logically while making it easier for people to make an informed decision. Classic business examples of MECE groupings include: Company revenue Geographic location Stakeholder segmentation Example 2: Applying MECE to acquisition targets For a business example of MECE, imagine an enterprise is assessing companies to acquire. To make sure it considers businesses of all sizes, it categorizes target organizations by number of employees. It creates seven groups, ranging from companies with fewer than 100 employees to companies with more than 100,000 employees.The key here is making sure that there is no overlap and that all groupings are parallel, comparable and representative of companies of all sizes. At this point, a business can confidently assess its acquisition options based on the MECE framework.Types of MECE groupings So how do you come up with MECE groupings? Some common approaches are: Two-part frameworks: Think of ways to break your groups into two pieces, such as internal vs. external, direct vs. indirect or benefits vs. costs. Formulas: If you can use an equation, such as Profit = Sales – Costs, sales and costs are by definition MECE since they add up to the whole and figures can’t appear in both columns.  Item categories: Think of how you might categorize items such as different types of stakeholders, geographic area, customer segments, etc.  Processes: If you’re looking at a business problem related to processes, you can break down that process into discrete steps. Break problems into pieces: If you’re starting with a question such as how to improve employee retention, you might break that down into smaller pieces focused on the causes behind the problem (e.g., compensation, onboarding and training, burnout, etc.). It is critical at this stage to develop a hypothesis on what the root cause might be to help inform what the smaller pieces are comprised of.  Using an “Other” Category: It’s not always possible to come up with all potential possibilities. Here you can use separate buckets for the most relevant items and group the rest into “Other.” Regardless of approach, testing multiple hypotheses helps to find the best solution for each particular situation.How to structure your slide deck with the MECE principle Grouping ideas according to MECE forces you to clarify your thinking and can help determine how to best structure your Power Point presentation. Let’s look at the example of how to improve employee retention from above. Here’s what your original brainstorming list might look like: Increase compensation More robust employee training Improve health care package Increase yearly bonus Peer onboarding program Redistribute workload Increase 401(k) match  More paid time off Monthly check-ins to ensure employees have support No emails on weekends Provide career path options Mentor program Example 3: Applying MECE will help your audience see the larger picture, and help you determine how to structure the information Making time for higher-level thinking MECE can be time-consuming and demands critical thinking and analysis to unlock solutions that may otherwise be missed. In the fast pace of business, deadlines and competing priorities can distract from consistently applying the principle. When using the principle to break down a complex problem, it is often helpful to gather and present ideas using charts and visual aids to illustrate the different categories or segments of the analysis that can be easily understood by the audience.A Power Point add-in like think-cell helps to save time on building presentations, slides and charts. Being able to put together visually compelling slides with a few clicks frees up time for higher level thinking as opposed to formatting. For example: Charts can be instantly updated from Excel or Tableau, with automatic annotations to highlight the most important takeaway from the chart Dynamic process flows let you build complex layouts from basic elements like chevrons and text boxes Agendas let you quickly create divider slides that automatically update to reflect where you are in the presentation Mc Kinsey, Barbara Minto: “MECE: I invented it, so I get to say how to pronounce it” Barbara Minto, The Pyramid Principle Hacking the Case Interview, MECE Principle Slide Science, What is the MECE principle?

Using the Pyramid Principle to build better Power Point presentations        Resources     Content hub    Using the Pyramid Principle to build better Power Point presentations    9 min read  — by Akash Choudhary When you have an important Power Point presentation to give and a lot of information to cover, it can be difficult to know where to start. Whether it’s a monthly report, pitch deck, or research findings, you need to craft a clear and simple message without losing the essential details.That’s the aim, but it’s easier said than done. Particularly when you’re staring at a blank slide deck with little guidance on how to structure your presentation in a way that grabs, and keeps, your audience’s attention.In this article, we introduce the Pyramid Principle and show how it can be applied to Power Point presentations for more effective communication of your messages. We’ll provide a basic overview of how the Pyramid Principle works, key strategies for structuring your deck, and tips for creating more effective slides and presentations.Even if you do know how you want to structure your arguments, it can be tough staring at a blank presentation.

Download your free 30-day trial and never start from a blank slide again:Barbara Minto and the Pyramid Principle of communication Effective communication in business presentations isn’t achieved by chance. It’s achieved by adhering to structure and following a tight framework grounded in the principles of impactful storytelling.One framework successfully used by business professionals is the Pyramid Principle, a method for improving clarity of communications created by former Mc Kinsey consultant Barbara Minto. Minto spent decades training Mc Kinsey recruits on how to use this technique, eventually publishing her work in her book,\\xa0The Pyramid Principle.What is the Pyramid Principle?The Pyramid Principle focuses on presenting your top-level conclusion first, followed by supporting arguments, data and facts. The ideas presented can be mapped out as a hierarchy, with the level of detail increasing as you move down the pyramid.Why you should use the Pyramid Principle in Your Power Point presentations There is a temptation to present ideas in a bottom-up fashion. That is, you start by presenting all of your facts and arguments, ending with your conclusion. However, presenting your conclusion first and then addressing details is a more effective way of communicating for several reasons: Starting from a high level and moving into greater detail makes it easier for your audiences to understand your story or argument. Business leaders think from a big-picture perspective, and generally want to know the solution before digging into the data behind it. If you start with your conclusion, it serves as a reference point or north star, meaning you are less likely to lose the thread of your story. Top of the pyramid: structuring your introduction Your presentation introduction, typically represented by an executive summary slide, is the top of the pyramid and should include your key conclusion or recommendation. Crafting this executive summary first can help you organize the body of your presentation.Your executive summary slide should include three key elements: Situation: Start with a self-sufficient and uncontroversial statement on the topic which the reader can automatically understand and agree with. Complication: What is the change or problem you will address? In other words, you want to answer the question, “Who cares?” Resolution: This is the main point you’re trying to make. Here you may also summarize your main supporting arguments to help orient your audience to where your presentation is going. These elements mirror classic storytelling principles, providing a structure the brain already recognizes. Here’s an example of what this might look like in practice:Situation For decades, China has been considered the factory of the world Complication Today, rising labor costs and supply chain challenges are leading companies to seek new manufacturing bases in other Asian countries Resolution Acme Company should evaluate new suppliers in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Malaysia as cost-effective alternatives to manufacturing locations in China Middle of the pyramid: organizing your supporting thoughts Your supporting thoughts should form the middle of the pyramid, sequencing your main arguments in logical order. According to Minto, there are four ways to order your ideas: Deductively, as in presenting the premises of an argument Chronologically, for example a month-by-month comparison Structurally, for instance comparing business performance in several different locations Comparatively, or in order of importance Each main argument raises the question of why, which you then answer with supporting data and facts. Every level of the pyramid should summarize the details that follow, with the points presented at each level grouped into consistent categories.As you lay out your supporting thoughts, each slide should have just one message supported by one action title. You can even outline your presentation starting with your action titles and then fill in supporting facts and data.Combining the Pyramid Principle with the MECE Principle The MECE Principle is a strategy for organizing information in a way that is Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) and helps you adhere to the Pyramid Principle. In other words, all points are covered and grouped logically without overlap.MECE Principle example: Microsoft products and services Let’s look at a basic overview of Microsoft products and services to show how the MECE Principle works. In theory, all products and services would fall into one of the subcategories: software, P Cs and devices, cloud services, or repair & maintenance. You could then further break down each of these subcategories into specific products or services, like Microsoft 365, Microsoft Surface, Xbox and Azure.When applying MECE to the Pyramid Principle, each level of the pyramid can use the MECE principle to ensure insights and ideas are grouped such that they are distinct and easy to comprehend.Bottom of the pyramid: presenting data and facts The Pyramid Principle helps to guide the structure of whole presentations, but Power Point users can also apply it to individual slides, especially when they are comprised of data and facts.Within the structure of a slide, the title represents the top of the pyramid and should contain the most important takeaway from your data. Too often, slide titles fail to communicate a meaningful message by simply presenting standalone data without context. Moving down the slide to the middle of the pyramid, you can then list key arguments, before finishing with your data as the evidence that supports them.Pyramid Principle example: Power Point slide with Minto’s messaging structure Here’s an example of what a Power Point slide built according to the Pyramid Principle might look like.Ultimately, using the Pyramid Principle is akin to starting at a 10,000-foot view, circling down into ever greater levels of detail. Using this principle to present your conclusion, sequence your arguments and support them with facts helps your audience better digest your message and avoid confusion. Moreover, it can help you make polished slide decks faster with less stress, helping you present with confidence for a better overall result.Applying the Pyramid Principle to data-driven slides When it comes to data-driven slides, it’s important to present your data in a way that highlights your main argument. Power Point add-ins like\\xa0think-cell\\xa0can help you quickly create sophisticated charts that you can easily adjust to emphasize the most important datapoints.Not only does this help get your message across more effectively, but it also lets you focus your energy on refining your arguments, rather than struggling with slide layouts.

How often have you stared at an empty slide without knowing where to begin? With the library, now available as part of the think-cell Suite, you can skip the painful start and jump straight into building a world-class presentation.The library isn’t just a collection of templates. It gives you access to a wealth of internal and external assets, replete with powerful search and filter options. As the library is a fully integrated part of think-cell, it combines with our other tools to further increase productivity. In this article, we’ll explain how you and your teams can get the most out of the think-cell Library to improve and accelerate your Power Point workflows: Start quickly from the think-cell tab Stop staring at blank slides Build structures that save time and strengthen collaboration Use a setup that fits your personal approach Search effectively to find what you need faster Uphold consistency with central content Elevate your resources to maintain brand compliance Don’t Google images you can’t even use You can try out the library with a free 30-day trial. It’s easy to set up, and gives you unlimited access to the library, as well as all other features within the think-cell Suite.Start quickly from the think-cell tab To get started, you can access the library from its prominent position next to the Charts menu in the think-cell tab. For convenience, you’ll also find the library on the far left of the Insert tab. If that’s where you naturally go to add a new slide to your presentation, this gives you the easy option of using the library rather than starting with a default slide.The library is your gateway to templates and slides that will jumpstart your presentation creation. To take full advantage of the resources at your disposal, you’ll want to structure them in a way that works for you. Let’s dive into the different ways you can do this.Stop staring at blank slides Whether you’re building a new presentation or adding to an existing one, the first thing you need is a slide. Nobody likes starting from scratch so you’ll often duplicate an old presentation or look around for slides you can copy.There’s no reason to reinvent the wheel every time and there are several advantages to working from an existing presentation. However, trying to reuse old work can come with its pitfalls: You can’t find the slides you need. You haven’t got access to the right version of a slide. You don’t know how a file has been edited, which can mean that slide layouts or fonts might be inconsistent. One solution is to provide a master deck to ensure that all presentations are on-brand and use pre-approved slide layouts. However, as master decks are implemented top-down, it’s near-impossible to cover the needs of every employee with a single file.The library solves this. It gives you valuable resources and the freedom to structure them how you need. By combining consistency and flexibility, the library helps you cut the time you spend staring at blank slides.To see what the think-cell library is capable of, check out our features page or watch the video below for a quick demo:Build structures that save time and strengthen collaboration Teams can lose a lot of time—and create a lot of extra work for themselves—simply because files are spread across different folders, local machines, and even that group chat from four months ago. A common strategy is to use a team folder that everyone has access to, but maintaining order and structure can be difficult because people naturally work in different ways.People brought up on hierarchical directories and subdirectories tend to feel comfortable when there is a certain logic to their file systems. If this is you, you can achieve this with the library by having three main folders for company, team, and personal presentations. You can then drill down into any of these and their subfolders, depending on what exactly you’re looking for.The team directory can be a shared repository that serves as a bottom-up pool of resources. If someone has created a new slide worth sharing, they can quickly put a copy in the team directory with the Save Slides tool. Because the library automatically recognizes new files, you can add slides for everyone to access, without causing any interruptions.Sharing best practices strengthens collaboration and saves the whole team valuable hours the next time they need to create something similar. And because each individual slide is shown in the library as a hi-res vector image, you can easily browse by zooming in and out (CTRL + mouse wheel) to see what your colleagues have added. You can read the entire slide content—even the smallest footnotes—directly in the library view. This beats the old way of opening presentations based on names that sound vaguely relevant and hoping for the best.Use a setup that fits your personal approach If you prefer not to concern yourself with directory structures and just access everything via global search then firstly, you’re not alone, and secondly, the library has you sorted. Instead of choosing specific folders, you can simply add all your existing files.The library search is smart enough to only show images and Power Point-compatible formats, so you don’t need to worry about Word or Excel files cluttering up your results. However, there will still be times when you’ll want to use filters to find exactly the right slide for your current presentation.Filters are particularly valuable for identifying the specific version of a slide when there are several to choose from. Say you frequently work with different aspect ratios, such as one for print and one for live presentations. You don’t have to waste time going through presentations and double-checking sizes, or even rejigging layouts after realizing you’ve been working on the wrong one. With the aspect ratio filter, you know you’re adding the slide you need. Search effectively to find what you need faster The library’s search function doesn’t just look at file names. It also queries the text within presentations, so you can search based on content and the right slides will show up. This is great if you know what the topic is. Type in ‘market analysis’ or ‘budget forecast’ and you’ll see all the slides that include those terms. But what if you don’t know the name of a presentation or what text is on the slide? One idea is to add keywords to your slides when saving them. If you think you might want to use a slide again as a template—like a waterfall chart showing profit and loss for your business unit—then it probably won’t have the word ‘waterfall’ in the title. In this case, you can easily add a text box containing waterfall chart outside the slide area, ensuring that this slide will appear in the library for this search term.If it’s a specific chart type you’re looking for, rather than an old slide, you can also search the 250 slide templates that think-cell provides. These are easy to navigate, as they are both structured into folders by slide type and tagged with relevant keywords.Understanding how the library’s search works will help you find what you need reliably and quickly. To learn more tips and tricks, you can watch this short tutorial on think-cell Library search:Uphold consistency with central content Giving individuals the flexibility to create their own folder structures doesn’t mean the end of corporate templates and a return to the Wild West of presentation creation. Everyone can add a central asset folder to their library, which your brand team can keep up-to-date with master files, visual identity guidelines and relevant logos.Adding folders works without copies or uploads. Because the library picks up on any new or updated files and respects existing permissions, you can manage the central folder as normal. Anyone who can access it from their machine will always be able to find the latest brand assets they need for their presentations. Elevate your resources to maintain brand compliance Brand consistency across internal and external presentations is a key part of maintaining professionalism. While details vary, most companies will provide some kind of brand Power Point file that includes slide layouts, fonts and color palettes. Many invest heavily in building multiple themes for different purposes, as well as fully-fledged corporate presentation templates, style guides, and slide collections. Whatever you already have on this front, the library elevates your resources, rather than replacing them. You can filter by Power Point theme and, if you are using our slide templates, these will automatically adapt to the theme of your current presentation. This means you can use our best-practice layouts and be confident that colors, fonts and other visual elements will conform to your brand’s corporate identity. Don’t Google images you can’t even use As well as slides and slide templates, the library also covers images. Any image files in specified directories will be included, so if your company has an icon collection, team photos or other visual assets, you can add the relevant folders and you’ll be able to use the library’s powerful search to find what you need for your presentation. For new images or icons, a lot of people will turn to Google. But if you’ve ever tried using Google image search for your presentations, you’ve almost certainly encountered some or all of the following issues: You find an image but it has a watermark or unwanted logo. You have an image that looks transparent but isn’t. You can download an image but you don’t have the rights to use it. You have to pay for the image. The library lets you search external image databases that don’t have these restrictions. You have access to Pexels, Unsplash and Freepik out of the box, and there are others you can integrate if your company has an account. This gives you images and icons that you can use freely without copyright issues, and that you can easily add to your presentations without leaving Power Point.Library images, whether taken from your own folders or from online sources, are added as think-cell elements, so they maintain their proportions when cropped or resized. Nothing will be squished or stretched, and your presentation will stay clean, attractive and professional.The think-cell Library: laying the foundations for a successful presentation It has always been think-cell’s mission to save you time and help you create Power Point presentations more efficiently. The library is no different. It boosts efficiency by helping you start every presentation quickly and take full advantage of the resources available to your team.

You’ve probably sat through presentations that raised more questions than they answered and did more to confuse the audience than convince them. And there’s a simple reason for this: making great presentations isn’t easy. Power Point can be a powerful tool, but any presentation is only going to be as good as the skills and approach of the person who creates it.With our seven-step framework, you can easily become someone who makes presentations people understand, are convinced by—and even enjoy watching. We’ve also included a few tips and tricks to help you build a presentation that achieves what you want it to. We’ve broken down the whole process step-by-step, but you can also dive straight into the aspect of creating presentations you’re most interested in: Step 1: Build your presentation’s story Step 2: Write your action titles Step 3: Use a clean layout and formatting Step 4: Organize your bullet points Step 5: Choose the right chart for your message Step 6: Format your charts for maximum impact Step 7: Check accuracy and consistency—and check again For even more comprehensive information on how to create great presentations, you can read our free e Book on Power Point best practices:Before you start: Determine the type of presentation you want to create Before you can even begin making your Power Point presentation, you need to determine which type of presentation you’re giving. This isn’t a big task, but it’s an important one, as it helps ensure that the presentation you create is tailored towards achieving your overarching goal, which will influence the content, layout and structure of your slides.Four common types of Power Point presentation Most Power Point Presentations fall under one of the following four categories, which represent a continuum from light to heavy content: Key message presentations: This type of presentation is usually lighter in content and is designed to tell a persuasive story. Common examples would be a conference speech, TED talk or pitch deck. Recurring reports: Any presentation that is created on a regular cadence can be considered a recurring report. This includes monthly performance reports or presentations for regular team meetings where each team member contributes their slides. Presentations like this often include more detail to document results, trends or activities, and they often have a fixed layout with data that needs updating. Insights and research outcomes: Presentations such as survey data or market trend reports distill information from large datasets into high-level conclusions. Here, the aim is communicating the key takeaways from the research and presenting impactful conclusions to your audience. Documentation: This type of presentation provides detailed summaries of findings, typically with many charts and limited commentary. A documentation presentation is often made with the intent that the audience review it in detail on their own, rather than just absorb the information as presented. It’s quite likely that the specific presentation you’re creating will include elements from multiple categories. It may be a recurring presentation that includes insights from the latest iteration of a regular survey. In this case, you can combine features of both presentation types.Step 1: Build your presentation's story All types of presentation should tell a story. This first step is most critical in key message presentations or when presenting insights and research outcomes, but it applies across the board.There is extensive literature on the art of storytelling for business, and there is no shortage of courses on the subject available on online education platforms. Here, we’ll cover two aspects of storytelling that are most relevant for creating effective Power Point presentations.Develop your top-level message If the aim of your presentation is to convince your audience, you should first establish what your top-level message is. What is the single most important thing you want your audience to know after your presentation that they didn’t know beforehand? Examples of top-level messages might be: Information: Our division exceeded its quarterly growth targets by 20% Motivation: Our organization has the potential to be the market leader in our industry Conclusion: We recommend setting up a new subsidiary in the UK next year Whatever your message, you should try to break it down into a single sentence. This will help you focus on the core idea of your presentation and ensure that every slide is contributing to your argument.Use a structural framework With your top-level message in place, you can then choose a framework to guide how you structure the rest of the presentation.One popular option is the Pyramid Principle, a strategy for creating effective business communications ubiquitous in the consulting world. With the Pyramid Principle, you lead with your most important idea, followed by supporting ideas and facts. If your conclusion is that Acme Company should enter a new market, say it up front. Then go through each supporting argument in order of relative strength.An important corollary to the above is the\\xa0MECE Principle, which stands for mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.Compared with presenting a laundry list of ideas, MECE is a way to group them in a way that covers all relevant points without overlap. Using MECE to organize and group your ideas ensures a logically sound argument, while making the information easier for your audience to absorb.You can also choose to use another structural framework if you prefer, but you should certainly choose something. Having a clear structure not only makes things easier creating your presentation, but it gives you a point of reference to help when reviewing, making alterations or updating an existing presentation.Step 2: Write your action titles Having decided on the story you want to tell and how you want to structure your Power Point presentation, you can get down to creating your slides.An important thing to remember is that each slide should present exactly one idea, and that this idea should be summarized in a single action title. All information presented on the slide, including any charts or graphics, must support the action title.It is also important to avoid including any visual or textual elements that may convey or imply a different or conflicting message. Just as each slide contributes to the presentation’s top-level message, each element on the slide should contribute to the action title.A common strategy when creating presentations is to start by writing action titles for each slide to ensure they tell a complete story on their own. This is a similar approach to beginning with the chapter headings when writing an article or document. The action titles should be sufficient to verify that your presentation is consistent with your chosen structural framework. If it’s not clear, either something’s missing or the action titles aren’t expressive enough.Once all your titles are in place, you’re then ready to go through and add the slide contents such as bullet points and charts.Step 3: Use a clean layout and formatting There are various Power Point rules that are often a combination of numbers like the 5-5-5 rule. Whatever the exact numbers, the idea behind all of these is that you shouldn’t overload your slides with too much content. There shouldn’t be too many different elements, there shouldn’t be too many sentences, and individual sentences shouldn’t be too long.Whether you adhere to a strict rule or not, it is crucial when creating presentation slides to avoid overcrowding them with excessive information or elements that can create visual confusion. You can approach this by visualizing your slide as a table, laying out elements in columns and rows.Best practices for presentation layouts Commonly used slide layouts consist of either two, three or four sections, depending on the nature of the content and the desired visual representation. Other best practices for you to consider include: The rule of thirds: Placing elements at one-third or two-thirds from the edge of the slide, and particularly where these gridlines intersect, is a universal rule for building a visually appealing slide. White space: Resist the temptation to pack too much into your slides. Leaving sufficient white space is essential for readability and helping the audience take in each slide’s main point. Presentation type: Key message presentations will have less content on each slide, compared with documentation presentations that include more detail. Fonts: Use the same font color and size for titles and body text throughout your slide deck, ideally in a sans serif font like Arial, as this aids readability. Consistency is the main thing, but as a rule, titles should be 20 to 24 point size, with body text 12 to 18 point based on the amount of content on the slides. Brand compliance Particularly for business presentations created for an external audience, brand compliance is key. As the presenter, you are an ambassador for your company and your presentation needs to represent your employer in the best possible way.On the one hand, this means building a slick, convincing presentation and delivering it professionally, but it also means ensuring that every slide is aligned with your brand’s corporate identity and visual style guidelines.This starts off straightforward enough, provided you use your company’s Power Point template, but when you’ve made multiple edits and iterations, possibly combining slides from several different contributors, you should definitely allow time to check the final presentation and confirm that no elements are veering off-brand.To learn more about how you can ensure brand compliance with think-cell, check out our user manual on setting up customized styles.Step 4: Organize your bullet points To avoid boring your audience, make sure you don’t have bullet points on every slide. One feature of great presentations is that they keep the audience’s attention by including some variety, which can apply as much to slide structure as to the specific messages of the content.It’s very likely, of course, that your presentation will include bullet points on some slides, which is absolutely fine. If used well, bullet points are a concise, effective way of communicating key information. There is a good reason that they’re a core part of most Power Point presentations, good and bad.Presentations are bad when they have overly long lists of bullet points—or lists with erratic levels of indentation—that can be confusing and hard for audiences to digest. Stick to three or five bullets. In some cases, you might stretch to a maximum of seven, but normally if you have that much to say, it’s better to break them up and use an additional slide. Do all seven bullet points really relate directly to the slide’s main message? As always, avoid packing in too much information in one slide, and ensure that all text supports the action title.A final aspect is the structure and syntax of your bullet points. Consistency is key, so if one bullet is a complete sentence, they should all be complete sentences. The same applies if using sentence fragments or individual words. Each bullet should start with the same part of speech, be it a noun, verb or adjective. And if using multiple levels of bullet points, make sure you have a consistent, logical hierarchy throughout your list.Step 5: Choose the right chart for your message Never include a chart just for the sake of it. But your presentation will be more convincing if you can provide evidence to support your messages, and charts are often the best way of presenting data-based evidence.So, if you have data that is relevant to the slide’s action title, then do include a chart that is best suited to helping you highlight what you want to communicate. Say It with charts by Gene Zelazny offers a useful approach to choosing your chart in three steps: Identify which aspect of the data your chart will highlight Determine what you’re comparing, whether it’s components, change over time or correlation Select your chart according to the comparison you’re trying to make. The mapping of some of the most commonly used chart types to data and comparisons is summarized in the following matrix. If you’re not familiar with all of these, you can find out more in the introduction to charting section of our user manual or our in-depth guides like how to create a waterfall diagram in Power Point.Step 6: Format your charts for maximum impact Choosing the best type of chart is one thing, but your chart’s effectiveness will depend heavily not just on the data, but on the design choices you make. For maximum impact, you’ll want to format and annotate each chart in a way that conveys your message and emphasizes what matters most, while avoiding confusion and—of course—ensuring that you adhere to your brand’s visual guidelines. This means: Including a chart title that summarizes the data and aligns with the slide’s action title Labeling both the x-axis and the y-axis with measurement units Using color sparingly to highlight the chart’s conclusion, for example using muted tones except for one key vertical bar which you highlight in a bolder color Adding trendlines and/or annotations to charts that can visually indicate patterns or trends in the data, for example, CAG Rs Displaying legends to help viewers understand the meaning of different colors, symbols, or patterns used in the chart Streamline your chart formatting with a Power Point add-in Even with the best intentions, it isn’t always easy in Power Point to format a chart exactly how you want it. Sometimes you need to resort to messy workarounds and sometimes a feature simply doesn’t exist. That’s why many professionals use Power Point add-ins to help them create better slide decks and charts faster.You can watch the video to see how easy it is to add chart decorations and annotations using think-cell:Dynamic charts, process flows, annotations and text boxes all help organize complex information into visually sophisticated presentations, so you can spend less time struggling with formatting and more time crafting your story to communicate your message.Looking for more inspiration?

Do core slide elements like titles, text boxes and charts jump around as you click from slide to slide, or is the positioning consistent? Are any placeholder elements still visible that should have been replaced or deleted? Do all figures mentioned in titles and annotations match the data displayed on charts? Are you using symbols and abbreviations (such as USD vs. $) consistently throughout the presentation? Inconsistent formatting, contradictory data or confusing headlines are a sure-fire way of losing audience trust. Unfortunately, it’s easy for mistakes to slip in when you’re working to a deadline. That’s why productivity tools that automate alignment and proofing tasks are a great way to ensure a polished final product and give you peace of mind at the most critical stage of the presentation creation process.Learn more about how the latest version of think-cell can help you improve the consistency and accuracy of your presentations:A process that makes creating easier and presentations better Building a Power Point presentation from scratch can seem like a tall order. By following our tips and breaking down the process step-by-step, however, you can make your life easier and be confident that you are producing high-quality outputs. With this approach, you have a method and the tools you need to consistently create presentations that leave your audience with a clear understanding of your message.If you’ve read this article and you’re looking for even more guidance on how to create great presentations, check out our free e Book on Power Point best practices:FAQ about creating Power Point presentations Here is a summary of some of the most frequently asked questions around how to make a great Power Point presentation.   How do I begin making a Power Point presentation? Like with any document, the best place to start when making a Power Point presentation is to understand why and for which audience you’re making it. That dictates the type of presentation you need to make, which helps you define the core message of your presentation. With that in place, you can proceed to build the presentation, ensuring that all slides and contents contribute towards communicating your main message.   How do you make a good Power Point presentation? It’s much easier to make bad Power Point presentations than good ones, but anyone can learn to make high-quality Power Point presentations by paying attention to clear structure, keeping texts short and formatting clean, and focusing on a core message. Those are the most important points. It gets easier if you have some strong data and a great story to tell, and even easier if you work with sophisticated Power Point add-ins like think-cell.   How do you structure your Power Point presentation? To structure a Power Point presentation effectively, you should draw on a framework such as the Pyramid Principle and/or the MECE Principle. These help you divide your messages or arguments into logical chunks that build on each other and feed into the main message of the presentation.These aren’t the only options. For example, for a more narrative presentation like a keynote speech for a large audience, you may find a presentation built around a story arc more appropriate.By working with a structural framework, you also have a way of checking your presentation to see if things are in the right order, something is missing, or if you have unnecessary information you can do without.   What is the 5-5-5 rule in Power Point? The 5-5-5 rule in Power Point refers to the length of paragraphs (five lines), the length of sentences (five words) and the length in time of each slide (five minutes) that you should aim for. The purpose of a rule like the 5-5-5 rule is to encourage people to make Power Point presentations that are concise, meaningful, and to the point.   What is the 10/20/30 rule? The 10/20/30 rule, coined by Guy Kawasaki, is a Power Point guideline for presentations that recommends limiting the number of slides to 10, keeping presentation time to 20 minutes or less, and not using any fonts smaller than 30 points. This is one of several popular rules for creating Power Point presentations that are geared towards keeping things short, low on text, and focused on the most important details.   What is the Kawasaki rule? The Kawasaki rule is another name for the 10/20/30 rule. It refers to Guy Kawasaki, a venture capitalist who is credited with its invention.   What is death by Power Point? The phrase ‘death by Power Point’ is a popular expression to describe the phenomenon of an audience being bored by a poorly created and delivered presentation. The implication is that many presentations in the corporate world are too long, confusing, and badly structured to communicate effectively and keep an audience engaged. The term is often used in advice pieces explaining ‘how to avoid death by Power Point’, such as David JP Phillips’ 2014 TE Dx Talk.Read more: How to apply the MECE principle to Power Point presentations  Learn about the MECE principle and examples of how to apply it, plus how to use it to create stronger Power Point presentations faster.

Discover your library and new tools. The ultimate guide to creating Power Point timelines        Resources     Content hub    The ultimate guide to creating Power Point timelines    20 min read  — by Akash Choudhary Timelines are an effective way of visualizing processes, such as historical milestones, product roadmaps, or project plans. Power Point is often the go-to tool for creating timelines, yet different types of timeline can have different purposes, and Power Point might not always be the best option.This guide will help you understand what to consider when creating a timeline, show you how to choose the right tool for the job, and explain how you can get the most out of Power Point when making your timelines. More specifically, the guide covers the following points: What kinds of timeline are there? Why use Power Point to create timelines? Disadvantages of Power Point for creating timelines Power Point alternatives: Different options for creating timelines Creating timelines in Power Point Power Point timeline FAQ Any timeline that goes beyond a certain level of complexity is best created with a powerful Power Point add-in like think-cell. You can download a free 30-day trial to see how think-cell can help you easily create best-in-class project timelines, and save you time in the process:What kinds of timeline are there?Timelines are used in a wide range of contexts, but almost every timeline falls into one of two categories: Illustrative timelines: Focus on appealing presentation that helps tell an over-arching story Can include some major milestones or phases, but no detailed scheduling Used to share a vision or grand idea with a larger group Planning timelines: Focus on details and communicating precise information Including start and finish points, and durations of individual events Used regularly and updated frequently based on requirements and status of deliverables The table shows a few common examples of different types of timeline:Timeline Category Example History of a product Illustrative    Source: Coca Cola.

Why use Power Point to make timelines?If you are making a timeline as part of a bigger presentation that you are already building in Power Point, then it is the path of least friction to create your timeline directly within the software.The native capabilities of Power Point are most suited to illustrative timelines. You can use tables, shapes, smart graphics, and icons however you like. Combining these elements—together with the ability to insert images from other sources—gives you a wide range of possibilities for building attractive timelines to help tell your story.Power Point even offers a range of pre-supplied timeline templates which anyone can access by selecting ‘New’ from the File menu and typing timeline into the search field.    Disadvantages of making timelines with Power Point                                 Most Power Point diagrams, even complex ones like waterfall charts, can be linked to a datasheet or Excel spreadsheet, meaning that the Power Point charts can update automatically if the data changes.This doesn’t work for timelines. In fact, the primary disadvantage of making planning timelines with Power Point is that they tend not to be connected to a calendar or any other data source. This means that you have to update them manually if there are any changes.There are also issues with illustrative timelines, even though these don’t normally need a connected data source. While it is possible to create attractive timelines in Power Point, they are usually difficult to edit as they rely on custom shapes or drawings.Take the product roadmap shown above (left). If you wanted to add a ninth element at the end—such as evaluation—you would have to resize, rebuild and redraw almost the entire template. You can’t easily add, remove or reorder elements, making templates like this more a source of inspiration than of significant practical value.If you’re trying to build appealing, accurate timelines and are looking for alternatives to what Power Point can offer, then you can download a free, 30-day think-cell trial and discover how easy it can be to build professional project timelines in minutes.Power Point alternatives: different options for creating timelines Given the limitations associated with making timelines in Power Point, it’s not surprising that users often look to other options—and that many businesses have entered the market with alternatives that aim to solve some of Power Point’s most pressing issues.For illustrative timelines that are designed for one-off use, you can use almost any illustration software to create a static image and copy it into Power Point. Planning timelines that need regular updating via a data connection are more complex. That’s why here we’ll look at two options for planning timelines: Microsoft Excel and one of the many web-based task management tools.Building timelines in Microsoft Excel Excel will often be the first place people used to working in the Microsoft ecosystem will look for any chart or visualization that is built around data. The data points relevant for planning timelines most commonly include: dates task lengths task completion percentages Excel has the advantage that any chart can be easily copied into a presentation and synced with Power Point. However, if you navigate to the Insert tab within Excel and click Charts, you will quickly realize that there are no in-built options for timelines.This becomes even more evident if you look at the timeline templates available within Excel for new presentations, which come in two general styles:    The left-hand option is essentially a table which lets you add dates and costs, and also includes data validation within cells to help you assign tasks and set statuses. Table views like this are hard to read, and a long way from any timeline visualization you can easily work with to get a clear overview of the project.                                 The template on the right is an attempt to create a Gantt-style project plan. As this functionality doesn’t exist in Excel, it relies on workaround solutions that are unintuitive, easy to break, and don’t result in clear or aesthetically appealing outputs.Although it looks like a project plan, the example shown is technically built using a scatter chart that adds error bars to the data points to represent the task durations. It’s not hard to see why building timelines with hacky solutions like this is an unsatisfactory experience, hard to scale, and produces outputs far below the standard expected of a professional presentation.Web-based task management tools Many companies and teams choose to work with one of the countless web-based task management tools that are currently available. The precise functionalities of these tools vary slightly, with some having a focus such as software development, and others aiming to appeal to a broader audience.All these task management tools offer some kind of timeline visualization that is synced to the data in the individual tasks and is often customizable in different views, such as burn-down charts for development sprints.While these tools can be extremely valuable in helping teams manage their projects effectively, there are inherent disadvantages to using the built-in project timelines for visualization purposes: Access: Companies have to manage who can view, edit or administrate different areas of a platform, meaning that there can often be friction if trying to share a project timeline with an audience outside of the immediate team. Control: Task management timelines can be fairly rigid in the available customization options, meaning that you don’t have full control over what you hide and what you display. Information surplus: Timelines constructed from tasks are usually overloaded with details that are unlikely to be relevant for most audiences, making it difficult to easily digest what matters. Environment: Working with a timeline in a web platform is fine when you are interacting with the tasks in that same tool, but as soon as you want to incorporate it into another environment, you usually have to rely on clunky embeds or screenshotting. Layout and branding: If you do copy or export a timeline from a web-based tool into a Power Point presentation, the design won’t match the layout and visual style of the rest of the deck. These drawbacks shouldn’t be seen as criticisms of the platforms. They simply stem from the fact that these tools prioritize task management functionality—as this is their core offering—over timeline visualization concerns.Creating timelines in Power Point If you do decide to create a timeline in Power Point, then—besides trying to construct a timeline completely from scratch—there are three main approaches you can take, which we’ll describe in more detail below: Smart Art: Work with Power Point’s smart graphics for simple process diagrams or milestone timelines Design template: Start with one of Power Point’s existing timeline templates and try to adapt it to your needs Power Point add-in: Install a productivity add-in like think-cell that supports the creation of powerful Gantt charts and planning timelines   “When I move companies, the first thing I ask for is think-cell.

These are most suited to creating a basic event timeline, milestone timeline, or process timeline. Navigate to the Insert menu.  Select ‘Smart Art’ under the ‘Illustrations’ group. Click on the ‘Process’ option, which will open a window with several graphics.  Look for the option called ‘Basic Timeline’ or ‘Circle Accent Timeline’. Select your preferred style. Once selected, it will auto-populate on the slide. Once you have a Smart Art graphic on your slide, you can add valuable information to your timeline such as key dates, milestones, initiatives, and deliverables. You can use information hierarchy to ensure information is delivered clearly.Options for editing your milestone timeline include: Text can be typed directly into the text boxes appearing as [Text] The Text Pane, which appears to the left of the timeline, is linked to the text boxes. You can add additional texts, which will generate additional milestone bubbles on the timeline. When editing an existing, you can use Tab to create bullet points at different levels. Edits you make directly in the text boxes will also be reflected in the Text Pane. When you have the Smart Art timeline selected, the Smart Art Design\\xa0tab appears in the Power Point ribbon. Here, you can access full text editing functionality through the\\xa0Create Graphic\\xa0command group.The available functions are: Add Shape: Adds milestones to your Power Point timeline chart. Add Bullet: Adds a sub-bullet to your selected text. Text Pane: Gives you access to your Text Pane window to the left of your chart. Promote/Demote: Shifts text hierarchy one level up or down (i.e., milestone, bullet, or sub-bullet). Move Up/Down: Shifts the order in which information is shown. Right to Left: Flips the direction of your timeline from left to right or from right to left. This will flip not just texts, but also other elements, including the arrow and the milestone bubbles. Layout: Only available for certain Smart Art graphics. Grayed out for milestone timelines. With your information inserted, it’s time to customize your timeline. For example, you may want to change your chart style, colors, font, or shapes within your timeline. Here, you have a few options: Individual shapes, like the arrow or the milestone bubbles, can be selected with the mouse and moved, resized or reformatted—either via the ribbon menus or the context menu that appears when you right-click an element Format options applicable to the whole chart can be selected from the Home or Format tabs. Use these to change font colors or to edit the chart background. Preset chart styles or alternative layout options can be selected from the options in the Smart Art Styles or Layout sections of the Smart Art Design ribbon tab. While Power Point’s Smart Art graphics do provide some intelligent features, like adding shapes and text simultaneously and resizing elements to fit the chart area, they ultimately lack the flexibility needed for anything beyond a very simple milestone timeline.How to create a timeline from a Power Point design template Microsoft provides a seemingly endless library of design templates to help users get started with Power Point without having to build up their presentation from a blank canvas. Most available timeline templates are of a more illustrative nature, so we’ll focus on them in this example.The easiest way to find a design template is to go to File, New via the Power Point ribbon and use the search bar to find relevant templates. Navigate to the\\xa0File menu. Select ‘New’. Enter a search term, like timeline (or something more specific like history timeline), into the search bar.   Browse the results for your preferred option, left-click and click “Create” to start a new presentation with the chosen design template.   Most design templates include the following elements that you can edit: Placeholders: For text or images, you can click to insert your content into the timeline in the correct place and with the predetermined styling. Text boxes: Often populated with generic text like “Add slide title” or “Date”, you can edit these by adding meaningful information. When trying to edit some text elements, you might find that they cannot be easily selected. This is normally because the element is part of the template’s Slide Master. To edit these, you can navigate to View and choose Slide Master from the ribbon.Editing templates isn’t always intuitive, which is why there is often a link to a short set of editing instructions included in the presentation. However, there are several challenges when working with timeline templates in Power Point: Lack of flexibility: Most templates are pre-designed with a fixed number of milestones or stages. If you want to add or remove a stage, your options are highly limited. Inconsistent construction: Each design template is unique, so there is always a certain learning curve when working with a new template before you understand how it is put together. Non-standard shapes: Templates often include illustrations created with custom shapes that may not be relevant to your timeline. You can easily change colors and sizes, but you may often have to delete the provided shapes and add your own shapes, icons or graphics. Clunky editing: As templates tend to include a mixture of elements, some of which are on the slide and some are within the slide master, inconsistencies can occur when trying to change fonts, colors, or styles. You have to switch frequently between views to make sure you have all elements edited correctly. No data behind planning timelines: Working with the templates for Gantt-style project plans can be highly frustrating, as they require manual sizing and positioning of all objects. This makes simple tasks like adding rows extremely cumbersome and liable to errors. This all means that you should always pick the template that is as close as possible to the timeline you are trying to make—and even then you should be prepared to encounter issues. Design templates are a useful showcase demonstrating what is possible with Power Point, but they are limited in terms of practical or scalable use.How to create a project timeline with a Power Point add-in Project timelines, also known as Gantt charts, calendar timelines, or project trackers, differ from simple milestone timelines in that they allow for a more detailed visualization of a project and its plan, including activities, milestones, key dates, owners, and relevant comments.Power Point’s Smart Art graphics and design templates don’t allow for flexible project timelines, so the best way to create this kind of visualization within Power Point is by using an add-in designed specifically for this purpose.The number one Power Point add-in of this nature is think-cell,\\xa0which—as well as offering a range of other chart types and features—lets you create and update detailed project timelines directly in Power Point.In this guide, we will show you to how to create, edit and format a detailed project timeline using think-cell. If you’re not currently a think-cell user, you can still follow the steps described here by downloading it for free. It’s a 30-day free trial that you can easily install to gain access to all the features of the software:Once you’ve got think-cell installed in Power Point, you can get started by easily inserting a project timeline into your slide. Navigate to the Insert menu. Select ‘Elements’ under the ‘think-cell’ command group. Select ‘Gantt/Timeline’ and position your chart on your slide. A major advantage of using a Power Point add-in to build your project timeline is the underlying calendar. This means that all task bars and milestones are tied to specific dates, making the timeline not only highly accurate, but also far easier to update.think-cell’s automations and intelligent algorithms remove the manual labor associated with editing project timelines, making it efficient and quick. As a rule of thumb, you right click to add, remove, or adjust features on your timeline, while you left click to style and format individual elements. For example: Adjust the visible date range by right-clicking (or double-clicking) on the timescale at the top of your chart to access the chart ‘Calendar’ and adjust start and end dates. Add or delete activities by right-clicking on the activity column section of an activity row and selecting ‘Delete’ or ‘Insert Row’. Add timeline items such as activity bars or milestones by right-clicking on the timeline section of an activity row and selecting ‘New Bar’ or ‘New Milestone’. Dates for these elements can be adjusted with a simple drag-and-drop or through their respective ‘Calendars’. Add activity owners or commentary by right-clicking on the activity column section of an activity row and selecting ‘Responsible’ or ‘Remark’. Style and format chart elements by left-clicking on a given element for quick access to formatting commands like font, font size, color, and style.

Why create a timeline in Power Point? Timelines are a great way to help your audience visualize a roadmap. They are a powerful way to show milestones, goals, or deadlines in a way that everyone can understand. They offer a strong solution to structuring and time-bounding a process and communicating this structure to your audience.   How do I create a timeline in Power Point? Power Point offers some simple options for creating a basic timeline, including illustrative Smart Art\\xa0graphics and a library of timeline templates. If you are aiming to make a fairly simple milestone timeline, you may find that Power Point’s native capabilities are enough to meet your needs.For more sophisticated timelines, particularly if they are tied to a calendar you can update, you should work with a Power Point add-in like think-cell that lets you build complex project timelines.   How do I access free timeline templates in Power Point? Outside of creating your own timelines, you can also access predefined templates in Power Point. When you create a new Power Point document, you can either commence with a ‘Blank Presentation’ or with a template presentation. Searching for ‘timeline’ amongst these templates will give you a selection of editable timeline templates to use.   How do I best show a timeline in Power Point? The type of timeline you should use depends on your needs. If you’re looking to simply show key dates and simple information in sequential order, then a simple illustrative milestone timeline will do. If you’re looking to build a detailed project plan, then you should consider a project timeline, also known as a Gantt chart or calendar timeline.   How can I make a vertical timeline in Power Point? The process diagrams within Power Point’s range of Smart Art graphics include some vertical options. However, due to the horizontal format of Power Point presentations, a vertical timeline is normally not the best way of representing a process and making best use of the available space on a slide.   How can I show project progress in Power Point? Power Point provides a number of templates for representing the progress of simple projects. You can find these under Smart Art in the Insert menu. The Smart Art diagrams use different combinations of linked shapes, arrows, and text boxes to represent process flows. These are most useful for depicting simple milestone-based processes.To show the progress of a project in any kind of detail, you should use a Power Point add-in like think-cell that lets you build complex project plans.   How do I create a project timeline in Excel and link it to Power Point? The most basic way of transferring an Excel-based project timeline into Power Point is by copying the data in Excel and pasting it into a Power Point slide, using ‘paste special’ to either paste it as an image or as an editable table. Alternatively, you can use the ‘Object’ command in Power Point to paste an editable image of your Excel project timeline in Power Point.If you want to connect a think-cell Gantt chart to data in an Excel spreadsheet, you can refer to our\\xa0user guide.Read more: Waterfall charts in Power Point: your step-by-step guide  Learn what waterfall charts are, why they are effective, and how to create them in Excel or Power Point to convince your audience and help your decision-making.

Gantt chart (timeline)        Resources     Manual    Gantt chart (timeline)    Icon in Elements menu:    A project timeline (sometimes called Gantt chart) visualizes project activities. The scale of a project timeline is a calendar. The duration of activities is represented by bars or process arrows, whereas singular events are represented by milestones.Contents13.1 Calendar scale Naturally, in a project timeline the scale is based on dates. With think-cell, you can quickly change the visible date range. The appearance of the scale is initially automatic, but can be manually modified if needed.13.1.1 Modifying the date range When inserting a new project timeline, the calendar is initially scaled to show some time before and some time after the current date. There are two ways to change the date range that is shown. You can open a calendar and select the dates you want:  Double-click on a scale, e.g., the bar showing months, to open the calendar dialog.  Alternatively click the     \\xa0Open Calendar button in the chart menu.    Today’s date is marked red.  Select the desired start date with a single click, and select the desired end date with another click while holding down Shift. You may also just hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse along to determine a range. In the upper right corner you will find additional information about the selected period.  Alternatively, you can use the cursor keys ← → ↑ ↓ and Pg Up Pg Dn to select a different date range. To expand the range, hold down Shift while moving.  To edit a date range you can grab its beginning or end and drag it to the desired date.  To scroll the calendar one line at a time, use your mouse’s scroll wheel, click the scroll bar arrows, or drag the scroll bar handle. To scroll the calendar one page at a time, click onto the scroll bar above or below the handle.  To jump to an arbitrary date, select the desired month and year using the controls in the window’s toolbar. You can simply type in the desired year, if you do not want to use the control’s up/down buttons. The calendar immediately scrolls to the desired position.  You can vertically resize the window to see more months at a time, and you can horizontally resize the window to adjust the font size. The width of the window does not have an impact on the calendar layout: One line always represents precisely one month.  Changes to the selected date range are immediately reflected in the chart. To close the calendar dialog, simply click the close button, or click into the main Power Point window. Alternatively, you can simply change the date range by dragging the ends of a scale in the chart:  Select a scale, e.g., the bar showing months.  Click and drag the handle that appears on the selected scale. The current date is displayed as a tooltip while you drag.  When you drop the handle, the chart is rearranged to accommodate the new date range.  While dragging the handles, they snap to integral units of the selected scale. You can quickly expand the chart to cover a large date range by dragging the handles of a scale with large units (e.g., years or months).    Note: When you modify the date range in such a way that a timeline item (see 13.3 Timeline items) in the chart becomes invisible, any custom label text you have entered attached to that item will be discarded, and only the (start and/or end) date will be shown in its label when it later becomes visible again by enlarging the date range. This is to prevent accidentally storing sensitive information in currently invisible parts of the chart that can then be accessed by someone with whom only a narrower view was meant to be shared simply by enlarging the date range. If you have accidentally narrowed the date range so that some label text was lost, you can simply Undo (Ctrl+Z) to restore it during the same Power Point session.13.1.2 Scale display  When changing the date range or the size of a chart, some scales as well as vertical separator lines may appear or disappear. Based on the range you select, together with the chart size and font size, think-cell suggests appropriate scales and separators to show. To make good use of this function, you should first select the desired date range before manually adding or removing scales or separators. Altogether, there are five scales available in the project timeline chart: Years, quarters, months, weeks and days. In addition to showing or hiding scales, think-cell supports several options to change the look of the calendar. All of these settings are available in the floating toolbar of the Gantt chart or one of the currently visible scales:  Using Scales, show or hide each of the five available scales (years, quarters, months, weeks, days). Depending on the chart’s current size and date range, some scales will automatically be disabled again because there is not enough room to show their units. Once you decide to show a scale it will not hide again automatically, even when the chart’s size or date range is changed, unless it cannot fit in the chart.  Using Separators, show or hide vertical separator lines for each of the available scales (years, quarters, months, weeks, days). Separators may not be shown even if they are enabled if there is not enough space in the chart to display them.  Enable or disable Automatic Scales/Separators. When enabled, think-cell shows appropriate scales and separators depending on the date range, chart size and font size. Once you explicitly show or hide a scale or a scale’s vertical separator lines, this option is disabled. When you enable it again, think-cell reverts to the scales and separator lines shown automatically.   You can also configure a fiscal calendar for use in the scale of Gantt charts via think-cell\\'s style file. If a fiscal calendar is configured in the loaded style file, an additional Fiscal Year option will be shown in the Scales menu. See C. Customizing think-cell for information on style files generally, and  D.11.2 fiscal Year for how to configure the fiscal calendar specifically. Each scale supports various ways to display date information, e.g., the months scale may show month names like “September” or numbers like “09.” You probably want to choose the appropriate format depending on the available space.  To do so, select the scale with the mouse and use the floating toolbar that appears to select the desired format. Since the dropdown menu is actually a date format control (see 13.6 Date format control), you can also type in arbitrary date format strings. Note: As with other labels, you can add arbitrary text to the scale labels, such as footnote markers or short comments. The Gantt chart’s floating toolbar offers the following additional options:  Choose between Plain Weekends, Shaded Weekends (weekends are shown in a different shade) and Collapsed Weekends (weekends are not shown in the chart).  Weekend: ...: Here you can choose the days that match the weekend in your country.  Week Starts on ... lets you set the day that the think-cell calendar will use as the start of week.  If you have previously adjusted the visible date range and want to reset it, choosing     \\xa0Fit Scale to Data from the chart’s context menu adjusts the date range such that all bars, milestones and brackets become visible.13.1.3 Scale labels and separator lines Each scale supports an optional label and optional separator lines. To use these features, open the context menu for the desired scale with a right-click.    Note: Primary and secondary separator lines are automatically assigned different styles. The scales’ context menu offers the following buttons:    Delete (Shortcut Del)Delete the selected scale. You can show the scale again using the Scales menu from the toolbar. When you deleted a scale it will not show again automatically, even when the chart size or date range is changed.                                     Open Calendar (Shortcut double-click)Open the calendar dialog (refer to 13.1.1 Modifying the date range).                                     \\xa0Add Vertical Separator Lines Explicitly add or remove vertical separator lines for the selected scale. You can also remove separator lines by selecting them and pressing the Del key. The software automatically adds and removes these lines unless you are making an explicit choice.                                     Add Scale Label Add descriptive text to the selected scale. The label contains language-dependent predefined text which can be replaced as needed.                                  An example for a typically used scale label is to write “Week of” to the left of the week scale if the first day of each week is shown in the scale labels:  Enable the week scale in the Scales menu.  Select one of the labels in the week scale and change the date format to include d or dd to show the first day of the week in the label.  Choose     \\xa0Add Scale Label from the scales’ context menu.  \"Week of\" is the default text of the week scale label. 13.2 Rows (Activities) A project timeline is made up of rows, each representing a certain activity that is named in the label to the left. The rows, in turn, contain timeline items such as bars, milestones and brackets. You can explicitly select an entire row to change its look, add or remove labels, drag it to another location or use Shift+Alt and the cursor keys ↑ and ↓ to move it.    Note: There is a special row below the chart reserved for the most important milestones. You cannot add bars to this row, you cannot move it by drag-and-drop, and you cannot delete it. Otherwise, it is just an additional activity row which is always there.13.2.1 Adding and removing rows To insert a new row, select an existing row and use the     \\xa0Insert Row button in the think-cell context menu. Alternatively, press Ctrl+Alt+↓. If all other rows are deleted, there is still the extra row left at the very bottom of the chart which you can click to open the context menu and create new rows. The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+↓ also inserts new rows while editing labels, and the first label of the newly inserted row is automatically selected. This way you can add rows and keep typing without reaching for the mouse. Likewise, you can use Alt and the cursor keys ← → ↑ ↓ to move the cursor across labels. You can also use the     \\xa0Delete button in the think-cell context menu to delete an entire row. The keyboard shortcut for deletion is Del.13.2.2 Row features Each row not only contains timeline items—bars, process arrows, milestones, brackets—but can also have up to three labels, a horizontal separator line, and row shading. The labels and decorations are added and removed using the think-cell context menu. To open the menu, move the mouse outside of the chart’s date range area and right-click on a row when it highlights. Note: When you right-click a row inside the chart’s date range area, another menu opens that allows for insertion of new timeline items. Refer to 13.3.1 Adding items for more information. The row’s context menu offers the following buttons. You can apply all of these buttons to one or multiple selected rows:    Delete (Shortcut Del)Delete the selected row.                                     Insert Row (Shortcut Ctrl+Alt+↓)Insert a new row after the selected one. If the selected row is the one below the chart’s bottom line, the new row is inserted before.                                     Add Activity Label Column (Shortcut F2)Add or remove the activity label column. A headline for the column is added which you can overwrite or remove if necessary. With F2 you can edit the selected row’s activity label.                                     Add Responsible Label Column Add or remove the responsibility label column. A headline for the column is added which you can overwrite or remove if necessary.                                     Add Remark Label Column Add or remove the remark label column. A headline for the column is added which you can overwrite or remove if necessary.                                     Add Row Shade Add or remove shading. You can change the shading’s color and also add or remove the shading using the fill control in the think-cell toolbar. Shading works also well for multiple successive rows.                                     Add Row Separator Add or remove a separator line above the selected row.                                 13.2.3 Row labels Each row supports up to three labels, resulting in up to three text columns next to the actual timeline. The default headlines for the three columns are language dependent (see 13.7 Language dependency), with “Activity,” “Responsible” and “Remark” used as the default English headlines. You are free to overwrite or remove them if necessary. The labels to the left are intended for names of activities. These labels are shown by default and each label belongs to exactly one row. If you already have the text for the labels available in some other place where you can copy them to the clipboard, you can quickly paste an entire label column (see 6.6 Pasting text into multiple labels). Note: Unfortunately, selecting multiple shapes in Power Point or labels in another Gantt chart does not work in this regard. Lines of text in a word processor, text editor or email or multiple cells in an Excel worksheet can be copied to the clipboard and pasted into activity labels as described above. You can organize activity labels in a hierarchy using Power Point’s Decrease/Increase List Level buttons in the Paragraph ribbon group on the Home tab. Alternatively, hold down Shift+Alt and use the arrow keys ← and →. The vertical space between indented labels is reduced to show that they are grouped. You can add up to two more columns if required. The labels for the headlines are automatically added when a column is created. The labels in the additional columns can refer to multiple rows (see 13.2.4 Labels spanning multiple rows). Initially, a newly created label column is empty except for its headline. Move the mouse over the label column to discover label placeholders, which you can select just as any other features in think-cell. Use the placeholder’s context menu to create either a text label, or a checkbox, or a Harvey ball. To quickly create a text label, you can simply select a placeholder and start typing. Similarly, you can recreate the headline labels, if you deleted them. The row label’s context menu shows the following buttons:    Delete (Shortcut Del)Delete the selected label.                                     Switch to Checkbox Use a checkbox instead of a text label (see 20.1 Checkboxes). If the selected label already contains text, the text will be discarded.                                     Switch to Harvey ball Use a Harvey ball instead of a text label (see 20.2 Harvey balls). If the selected label already contains text, the text will be discarded.                                     Switch to Text Label Use text for this label. Select and overwrite the placeholder text that is inserted when you click this button.                                     Add Bracket Add or remove the selected label’s bracket. Brackets are added automatically to labels that span more than one row (see 13.2.4 Labels spanning multiple rows). This option only applies to responsibility and remark labels. Since activity labels always refer to precisely one row, these labels do not need brackets.                                  To remove a label, use its context menu or simply delete all text from the label – it will then disappear. To remove multiple labels at a time, it is often convenient to select all desired labels using the mouse together with Shift or Ctrl keys (see also 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). Then, choose the delete option from the context menu, or press the Del key to remove all selected labels.13.2.4 Labels spanning multiple rows In both responsibility and remark columns, each label can refer to more than one activity. Drag the handles that appear next to the label when you select it, to determine the activities it refers to. You can only drag a label’s handles across rows that do not already have a label in the same column, and you cannot drag the handles across horizontal separators.    A bracket will automatically appear as soon as a label spans more than one row. In this case, you are free to remove the bracket by selecting it and pressing Del, or via the bracket’s or the label’s context menu.   13.3 Timeline items There are several types of items used in a project timeline to visualize periods of time and events. The following items are supported by think-cell:  Bars show the duration of some activity.  Pentagons/Chevrons, also knows as process arrows, are similar to bars but contain text. They grow and shrink vertically with the amount of text they contain. To create an aesthetically pleasing layout, all process arrows of a Gantt chart are resized to the same height, if possible.  Milestones mark singular events.  Brackets are used to label periods of time which typically comprise multiple activity bars.  Shades are used to visualize non-working times such as weekends or holidays. They are usually labeled by an additional bracket below the chart. 13.3.1 Adding items To add an item to the chart, move the mouse across the chart’s date range area. A crosshair helps you to track the row and date you are pointing at, and a tooltip provides precise date information. The dates that can be selected depend on the chart’s date range and size, and on your current zoom level. If days are too small to be pointed at individually, the crosshair snaps to firsts of weeks and firsts of months. If even weeks are too small to be distinctively selected, the crosshair only snaps to the beginning of months. Wherever the crosshair appears, it is possible to insert a new item. When you move the mouse over existing items, the crosshair disappears and the tooltip reflects that item’s date or date span.    With the crosshair highlighting, click the right mouse button to open the context menu.    Note: If you want to open the row’s context menu to insert a new row or to add some row label or decoration, you must right-click on the row outside the chart’s date range area. Refer to 13.2.2 Row features for more information. The context menu for insertion shows the following buttons:    Delete (Shortcut Del)Delete the selected row, separator line, or milestone line.                                     New Bar Create a new activity bar beginning at the crosshair position.                                     New Milestone Create a new milestone at the crosshair position.                                     New Bracket Create a new bracket beginning at the crosshair position.                                     New Shade Create a new shade beginning at the crosshair position.                                     New Pentagon/Chevron Create a new process arrow beginning at the crosshair position.                                  Note: You can also create new items by clicking and dragging existing items while holding down the Ctrl key. A copy of the original item is created at the new location.13.3.2 Moving items There are several ways to move existing items to another date or row. Obviously, you can drag one or multiple selected (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects) items with the mouse. If exactly one item is selected, you can also drag its handle(s) to adjust the date, or anchor it to another item (see 13.3.4 Anchoring items). You may double-click an item to open the calendar dialog for easy date selection. The current date of the selected item is pre-selected. For bars, process arrows, brackets and shades, select a date range as described above (13.1.1 Modifying the date range). For milestones, simply click on the desired date; the calendar dialog will close immediately and the selected date will be applied.13.3.3 Milestone positioning Bars and process arrows are positioned to begin at 0:00h on the start date and to finish at 24:00h on the end date. The default position of milestones is 12:00h. Nevertheless, if the day scale and the vertical day separator lines are not visible, then milestones are displayed at 0:00h on the appropriate day for better alignment, even if their position is 12:00h. The default positioning of milestones is usually correct but can be overridden, if required, by the use of anchors (13.3.4 Anchoring items). Anchoring a milestone to the end of a bar, for example, will ensure that the milestone is always aligned with the end of the bar, regardless of the currently viewed data range or visible scales.  The milestone date label usually shows the Date the milestone is positioned at, but switches to the Previous Day when the milestone is aligned with the end of a bar. You can manually change this using the milestone\\'s label content control.13.3.4 Anchoring items Using the handles of bars, process arrows, milestones, brackets and shades, you can attach these items to other items. When you click a handle with the mouse, the available anchors highlight. Drag the handle within the current row to set the selected item’s date manually, or drag the handle onto an anchor of some other item to attach it to that item.    Items remain anchored while they are being edited. For instance, when you anchor the start of a bar to a milestone, this connection enforces that the start of that bar is always at the same date as the milestone. In particular, whenever you move the milestone afterwards, the start of the bar will be updated accordingly.    For another example, inserting a shade implicitly creates an additional bracket which is anchored to the shade. When you move the shade, the attached bracket moves along. Still, you can detach the bracket, move it to a different location, or delete it. Note: Items can be anchored across different rows. When you drag an item’s handle, the date changes but the item remains in its row. To move an item to a different row, drag the item itself, not its handles.13.3.5 Changing the chart’s appearance You can change the color of bars, process arrows, milestones and shades using the color control in the floating toolbar (see 3.4.1 Color and fill). The background color of the chart can be changed by selecting the whole chart and choosing the desired color from the floating toolbar. You can also control the outline of bars and process arrows, as well as the shape of milestones, from the floating toolbar. For bars and process arrows, you can also select from a predefined list of styles, i.e. of combinations of color and outline. By way of the context menu, you can further configure the appearance of timeline items. The context menu for timeline items comprises the following buttons (depending on the type of the selected item):    Delete (Shortcut Del) Delete the selected item.                                     Open Calendar (Shortcut double-click) Open the calendar dialog for the selected item (refer to 13.3.2 Moving items).                                     Add Date Label (Shortcut F2)Add or remove a label for the selected item. By pressing F2, you can edit the label’s item, or create it if it does not yet exist. By default, the label contains the item’s date which is updated when the item moves (see also 13.3.6 Item labels).                                     Add Milestone Line Add a milestone line to the selected milestone.                                 13.3.6 Item labels Bars, process arrows, milestones and brackets can have labels, while shades are usually labeled by means of an additional bracket below the shade. Use the think-cell context menu to add a label to one or more selected items. If exactly one item is selected, you can press F2 to add a label to this item or edit an existing label. By default, an item label contains the item’s date or date span. This information is maintained in a text field (see 6.4 Text fields) and is updated whenever the item is moved. You can add text to the label or replace the default content with custom text.  If you deleted the text field you can always re-insert it into the label. Select the label and choose the desired field from the label content control in the context-sensitive toolbar (refer to 6.5.5 Label content). In particular, think-cell allows for large multi-line labels even in a relatively dense chart. All activities are automatically arranged to make the text fit. Moreover, most labels can be dragged to place themselves below or besides their respective item.   13.4 Datasheet The Gantt chart can use dates stored in a datasheet. You can then anchor timelime items to those dates. If dates in the datasheet change, the anchored timeline items are updated accordingly. This is similar to chart types which are based on numbers. In these chart types, the datasheet contains numerical values, and the chart is updated when numbers change. However, you also control the visualization of your data and add arrows and value lines in the chart, not in the datasheet. Let’s say you want to create a Gantt chart with five activities that each have their result validated at a milestone a few weeks after completion. You want to store all dates in the datasheet to easily update them later in a single window. You start by inserting a Gantt chart. Open the datasheet by clicking the     \\xa0Open Datasheet button in the bottom right corner of the Gantt chart.    The first row in the datasheet corresponds to the milestone row below the Gantt chart. Into the second row, you enter the first activity description and three dates: the start of the task, the end and the validation milestone, respectively.    Note: You need to enter the dates in a way that Excel recognizes as dates. If the cell content is right-aligned, Excel has recognized a date. Otherwise, Excel has only recognized your input as text, and think-cell will not be able to use it. When specifying a date and not including a time, Excel will assume the time to be 12:00am, i.e., the beginning of that day. When such a date is used as the end of an activity, the activity therefore is displayed as ending on 12:00am of that day, i.e., not including the day itself. If you want to specify that an activity ends with January 15th and includes that day, either enter 2017-01-15 11:59pm or 2017-01-16. You will notice two changes in the Gantt chart:    Three anchor points are displayed at the top of the first row, corresponding to the dates you entered into the datasheet.  A green line down the left of the first row indicates that this row is linked to the datasheet. The tooltip for the row contains the specific source: \"Linked to sheet row 2.\"  Now it is time to anchor timeline items to the dates from the datasheet:  Select the bar that remains from the default Gantt chart and anchor the beginning to the first anchor and the end to the second anchor.  Insert a milestone and anchor it to the third anchor.    Note: If multiple timeline items are selected in different rows and a handle is dragged to an anchor from the datasheet, each item is appropriately anchored to the respective date from its own linked datasheet row. Feel free to remove the other five standard rows that are not linked to the datasheet. Once you fill additional rows in the datasheet, corresponding activity rows will automatically be added to the Gantt chart as needed. At this point, you finish entering activity titles and dates into the datasheet:    While you type in the additional tasks and dates in the datasheet, the Gantt chart is automatically updated:  Once you start filling a new row in the datasheet, an activity row is added to the Gantt chart.  As you add dates to the datasheet, new timeline items are added to the Gantt chart. The new items are modelled on the items in the existing row above the new row.  New timeline items, i.e., the new activity bar and the new milestone, are automatically anchored in the same manner as those in the closest row—in this example, the row above. Of course, if the dates in the datasheet differ from row to row, the positions of the timeline items in the Gantt chart reflect this.  You have quickly created a complete Gantt chart with five rows and two items per row.    After you have defined the general structure in the first row, subsequent rows have automatically followed this structure without any more inserting and anchoring necessary.13.5 Excel link A Gantt chart can be linked to a range in an Excel file (see 22. Excel data links). Let’s assume that the dates from the example above reside in an Excel file you received:    To create a linked Gantt chart, do the following:  Select all cells in Excel, including the activity titles and the dates.  Include in your selection an additional row above the first activity title and dates. This additional row holds dates for the Gantt chart’s milestone row. Even if no such dates are present, this row needs to be included in your selection.  From the Charts menu in Excel’s think-cell toolbar, select the chart type Gantt/Timeline.  In Power Point, choose the appropriate slide and position for the new Gantt chart.  The range in Excel will be marked as linked:    The new Gantt chart will show your activity titles and the anchors for the dates in Excel, but no timeline items yet:    You can now insert timeline items like bars and milestones and link them to the anchors corresponding to dates in Excel. To quickly populate the Gantt chart, please  Insert and anchor items in the first activity row: one bar between the first two anchors and a milestone at the third anchor.  Select all timeline items in the first row.  Drag the items to the second row while holding down the Shift and Ctrl keys. In Power Point, a drag operation such as this would duplicate shapes while keeping them aligned. In think-cell, the result is the same: the timeline items are duplicated and aligned—anchored—to the respective anchors in the second row.  Repeat for the other rows.  Using drag & drop while holding down Shift and Ctrl you can quickly fill the Gantt chart with timeline items. If the dates in Excel change, the Gantt chart is updated as described in 22.3 Updating a linked element.13.6 Date format control You can freely set the desired formatting for date values that appear throughout the labels of a project timeline. All item labels of a chart share the same date formatting, so when you change the formatting for one label, all others will change accordingly.When you select a label that contains a date field, or select a date field within a label, the date format control appears in the floating toolbar. It works similar to the number format control (see 6.5.3 Number format).The dropdown menu facilitates one-click selection of the most commonly used date formats. Its contents depend on the feature that is selected, e.g., each scale offers a different set of predefined date formats.The edit box reflects the current setting and allows entering of arbitrary date formatting. The format codes used by Excel are supported, and some more codes were added for the particular purposes of the project timeline (see table below). Also, up to four of your most recently used custom formattings are available in the dropdown box.Date format codes are case-insensitive. You can insert a line break with the backslash character\\xa0\\\\.You can mix the format codes with arbitrary text and delimiters. If your custom text contains characters that can be interpreted as format codes, i.e., d D w W m M q Q y Y \\\\, you must enclose the text within single quotes\\xa0\\'. It will then be displayed “as is.” To use a quote character itself, type two single quotes\\xa0consecutively \\'\\'.13.7 Language dependency The project timeline chart is language dependent: The display of full or abbreviated month names, as well as names for weekdays, the default headlines for the activity labels and the default text for scale labels, depend on the proofing language set in Microsoft Office. This setting’s value is used at the time when the elements are inserted.The layout of the chart will also adapt to the reading direction of the language selected: When the proofing language is set to a right-to-left language, such as Arabic or Hebrew, the Activity column will be displayed on the right of the chart, the timeline will progress from right to left, and the Responsible and Remark columns will appear on the left of the chart.You can alter the language used for language dependent elements as follows:  Alter the setting to the desired language by  clicking into a text box,  choosing Review > Language > Set Proofing Language...,  selecting the desired language in the dialog,  clicking on Default... and confirming with Yes,  closing the dialog with OK.  Use the appropriate context menu to remove and then re-add the language dependent labels that you wish to update.  Use the Scales menu to first hide and then re-show the scales that you wish to update. 13.8 Date format codes Code Description Exampled day of month5dd day of month (two-digit)05ddd day of week (abbreviation)Mondddd day of week (full)Mondayddddd day of week (single character)Mw week of year7ww week of year (two-digit)07www \"Week \" + week of year Week 7wwww \"Week \" + week of year (two-digit)Week 07M month number9MM month number (two-digit)09MMM month name (abbreviation)Sep MMMM month name (full)September MMMMM month name (single character)SQ quarter (Arabic numeral)4QQ quarter (lowercase Roman numeral)iv QQQ quarter (uppercase Roman numeral)I Vyy year (two-digit)04yyyy year (four-digit)2004\\\\ (Backslash) line break, e.g., ddd\\\\dd Mon05\\'...\\' Insert custom text, e.g., \\'Quarter\\' qq Quarter IV\\'\\' The actual single quote character, e.g., \\'W\\'ww\\'\\'yy W07\\'04Introduction   1.

It provides an overview of the file, its content and its hierarchy, and brief explanations for logical subsections, showing what style settings can be defined for think-cell elements. It is followed by a description on how to work with style files in general and their specific structure in D.2 File structure. The detailed explanation of each element is given below, starting with D.3 Defining colors, line styles and markers.Contents D.1 Hierarchy of XML elements The following elements are used to define colors, lines, and markers respectively.

It is possible that a style file that is technically not fully valid, e.g., by omitting some elements, still loads in a given version of think-cell, but that may not hold true in future releases.D.2.1 style The style element is the root element of a style file. The mandatory attribute name sets the name that is shown in the    Tools menu as the currently active style. The attributes xmlns, xmlns:xsi and xsi:schema Location should not be changed from the example when creating a new style file. An optional attribute based On may reference a legacy base style. The corresponding .tcbasestyle file must be present in the installation directory to load a style file with the attribute based On. Style files created for earlier versions of think-cell continue to work unchanged. If you want to use additional elements that are only supported in the current release, you need to update the build number in the attributes xmlns and xsi:schema Location to the one shown in the following example. Example: At this time you may also need to make changes to other elements to make sure the style file adheres to the format described here.D.3 Defining colors, line styles and markers D.3.1 Colors A fill based on one of Power Point’s built-in scheme colors. The attribute val specifies the color using the values bg1, tx1, accent1, accent2, accent3, accent4, accent5, accent6, dk1, lt1, dk2, lt2, hlink, fol Hlink, bg2 or tx2. When using scheme Clr, the name attribute of the parent solid Fill element will typically be set to the same value as the val attribute. Then, think-cell will use the name that appears in Power Point’s scheme colors dialog, depending on the version of Power Point and the user interface language. Example: Percentage by which to modulate the luminance of a color. It is typically nested inside a scheme Clr to modify it, but can also modify the other color types described below. Example: Percentage by which to shift the luminance of a color, but with its hue and saturation unchanged. It is typically nested inside a scheme Clr to modify it, but can also modify the other color types described below. Example: A fill based on a color defined using values for the red, green and blue components. The attribute val contains six hexadecimal characters for the three components. Example: A fill based on a color defined using values for the red, green and blue components. The attributes r, g and b each contain numbers between 0 and 255. Example: A fill based on a color defined using values for the red, green and blue components. The attributes r, g and b each contain percentage values between 0% and 100%. The percentage values may use integers or decimal numbers with 2 decimal places and a dot as the separator. Example: A fill based on the preset colors defined in the Office Open XML standard. The attribute val specifies the color name and must be one of the names from Alice Blue to Yellow Green enumerated in Preset Color Values Enum or in subsection 20.1.10.47 of the Office Open XML standard. Example:D.3.2 Fills A fill based on a single color. The color can be specified using either one of the child elements scheme Clr, srgb Clr, or prst Clr. The attribute name contains the name shown in the color list. Example: A patterned fill based on a pattern and two colors. The colors can be specified using the child elements fg Clr and bg Clr describing the foreground and background color of the pattern respectively. The pattern itself can be specified declaring the attribute prst and referencing a pattern described in Office Open XML. The attribute name contains the name shown in the color list. Example: Describes the foreground color of a pattern fill. The color can be specified using either one of the child elements scheme Clr, srgb Clr, or prst Clr. Example: Describes the background color of a pattern fill. See fg Clr.D.3.3 Choices in the fill color control A list of fills, described by multiple instances of the elements no Fill, solid Fill, or patt Fill. The fills defined in this list are shown in the color control of the floating toolbar (see 3.4.1 Color and fill). Example: When the user chooses this special fill from the color control, e.g., for a segment, the segment has no fill color. The attribute name contains the default name used in the color control, which cannot be changed. A horizontal line in lists shown in the floating toolbar. It can be used inside fill Lst, fill Scheme List and lnfillmarker Scheme Lst elements. Example:D.3.4 Lines A line with certain weight based on a line type. The attribute w describes the weight of the line. The value for this attribute is noted in EMU (12700 EMU = 1 pt) with a maximum of 152400 EMU (= 12 pt). The attribute name contains a name used to reference this line style. The line type can be specified using the child element prst Dash. Example: A line style based on the pre-set line styles defined in the Office Open XML standard. The attribute val specifies the line type using the values solid, dash, lg Dash, dash Dot, lg Dash Dot, lg Dash Dot Dot, sys Dot, sys Dash Dot Dot, which correspond to the Office Open XML standard: Preset Line Dash Values Enum Example:D.3.5 Choices in the line style control A list of lines described by at least one instances of the element ln. The lines defined in this list are shown in addition to \"No line\" in the line style control of the floating toolbar (see 3.4.6 Line style). Furthermore, any line style referenced using ln Ref for use in line charts (see 7.4 Line chart), Universal connectors (see 8.2.7 Universal connectors) and waterfall connectors (see 9. Waterfall chart), outlines etc. must be defined here. Example:To describe each entry in the list, the w attribute of the ln element is converted to points, e.g., 3175 EMU to 1/4pt, and displayed together with a visual representation of the dash type.D.3.6 Markers A marker with a certain shape. The attribute name contains the name shown in the marker style list. The marker shape can be specified using the child element symbol. Example: A marker shape based on the preset marker shapes defined in the Office Open XML standard. The attribute val specifies the marker type using the values circle, triangle, diamond, square, star, x, hollow Circle, hollow Triangle, hollow Diamond, hollow Square, dash, dot, plus. Marker Style Values Enum Example:D.3.7 Choices in the marker control A list of markers described by at least one instance of the element marker. The markers defined in this list are shown in the marker control of the floating toolbar (see 3.4.9 Marker shape). Example:D.3.8 Chart background color The actual background color for think-cell charts. This is only necessary to specify if the charts are placed on a colored rectangle rather than directly on the slide background. This color is used for shapes that are meant to seamlessly blend in with the background, e.g., boxed labels and value axis breaks. Using solidfill Ref Background is a last resort. First you should try to fix your template with regard to slide background and theme colors. Only if this still does not yield the desired result, use solidfill Ref Background to explicitly define the chart background color. It is typically used together with def R Pr for text colors (see D.6 Customizing text properties).D.4 Using colors, lines and markers in schemes D.4.1 Choices in the Gantt shape style control A list of shape styles that can be referenced for defining the default style of the bubble of difference and CAGR arrows (see D.8 Customizing labels), and in the list of available of styles for bars and pentagons/chevrons in Gantt charts (see D.11.1 gantt). Individual shape styles are defined using the shapestyle child element. Example: A shape style. Must contain one fillref child element to define the background color of the shape, may contain additionally one lnfill child element and its subsequent child elements to describe the outline of the shape. Example:D.4.2 Choices in the color scheme control A list of think-cell color schemes that will be used in the color scheme control of the floating toolbar (see 3.4.2 Color scheme). Individual fill schemes are defined using the fill Scheme child element. Example: A color scheme consisting of a sequence of fills. It is defined by referencing fills using the child element fill Ref. The attribute name contains the name that is used in the color scheme control. The attribute fill Ref Other Series specifies which color to use for the Other Series (see 10.4 Other Series). If the optional boolean attribute reverse is set to 1, the list of fills will be applied in reverse order, starting with the first fill for the bottom-most series, the second fill for the series above, and so on. The optional boolean attribute repeat Last controls what happens after each fill has been used once, i.e., once the number of segments is larger than the number of fill colors. Per default, or when it is explicitly set to 0, additional segments repeat the fill colors, starting with the first, then the second, and so forth. If repeat Last is set to 1, the last fill color specified in the color scheme will be used for all subsequent segments. Example: Sometimes a color scheme works well for most charts, but less well for charts with very few series. For example, you may use a color scheme with one primary color, several shades of that color and then another primary color with several shades of it. If a chart only has two segments, you may prefer that both primary colors are used, instead of one primary color and one shade of it. You can solve this problem with the series Count Specific child element. A sequence of fills to be used as the color scheme if a chart has a specific number of series. The attribute series Count specifies for which count of series this sequence is used. You can use a range (series Count=\"1-3\") or a number (series Count=\"2\"). The chart automatically switches between the default fill sequence in fill Scheme and any specific fill sequences in series Count Specific whenever the number of series in the chart changes. Example: You can use multiple series Count Specific elements inside one fill Scheme if the ranges in the series Count attributes do not overlap. If none of the series Count attributes for any specific lists match the current series count, the sequence of fills from the parent element is used. series Count Specific supports the attributes reverse and repeat Last as for fill Scheme. A reference to a fill defined in the fill Lst element. The attribute name must match the value of the same attribute in the fill definition. Example:D.4.3 Choices in the line scheme control A list of think-cell line schemes that will be used in the line scheme control of the floating toolbar. Individual line schemes are defined using the lnfillmarker Scheme child element. Example: A line scheme consisting of a sequence of combined line styles. It is defined by describing line styles using the child element lnfillmarker, which references a line, a color, and a marker. The attribute name contains the name that is used in the line scheme control. If necessary, series Count Specific can be used with a different sequence of lnfillmarker for charts with only very few series (see series Count Specific). Example: A combined line style for line charts (see 7.4 Line chart) described by the child elements ln Ref, solidfill Ref, and optionally marker Ref referencing a line, a fill color, and a marker respectively. Example: A reference to a line defined in the ln Lst element. The attribute name must match the value of the same attribute in the line definition. Example: A reference to a fill color defined in the fill Lst element. The attribute name must match the value of the same attribute in the fill definition. Example: A reference to a marker defined in the marker Lst element. The attribute name must match the value of the same attribute in the marker definition. When omitted, no marker is used for this combined line style. Example:D.4.4 Choices in the marker scheme control A list of think-cell marker schemes that will be used in the marker scheme control of the floating toolbar (see 3.4.10 Marker scheme). Individual marker schemes are defined using the fillmarker Scheme child element. Example: A marker scheme consisting of a sequence of markers. It is defined by referencing markers using the child elements fillmarker, specifying the marker to be used, or no Marker, specifying that no marker is to be used. The attribute name contains the name that is displayed in the marker scheme control. If necessary, series Count Specific can be used with a different sequence of fillmarker for charts with only very few series (see series Count Specific). Example: A combined marker style consisting of a marker reference using the child element marker Ref and an optional fill color reference using the child element solidfill Ref. Example: An empty element specifying that no marker is to be used. Example:D.5 Customizing charts D.5.1 fill Scheme Ref Default A reference to a fill scheme that is used as the default color scheme for all chart types. If one or several of the elements are used, they override the default scheme set here for the corresponding specific chart type. If all of these elements are used, the fill Scheme Ref Default may be omitted. Example:D.5.2 fill Scheme Ref Default Stacked The default color scheme for stacked charts. Example:D.5.3 fill Scheme Ref Default Waterfall The default color scheme for waterfall charts. Example:D.5.4 fill Scheme Ref Default Clustered The default color scheme for clustered charts. Example:D.5.5 fill Scheme Ref Default Mekko The default color scheme for mekko charts. Example:D.5.6 fill Scheme Ref Default Area The default color scheme for area charts. Example:D.5.7 fill Scheme Ref Default Pie The default color scheme for pie charts. Example:D.5.8 fill Scheme Ref Default Bubble The default color scheme for bubble charts. Example:D.5.9 lnfillmarker Scheme Ref Default The default color scheme for line charts. Example:D.5.10 lnfillmarker Scheme Ref Default Combination The default color scheme for combination charts. Example:D.5.11 fillmarker Scheme Ref Default The default marker scheme for scatter charts. Example:D.6 Customizing text properties The default paragraph properties for text in labels and text boxes. Properties for new labels and textboxes are taken from one of the text style levels of the body text placeholder. The appropriate text style level is chosen heuristically, which works fine in most cases. This behavior is selected by not using the def P Pr element. If an inappropriate text style level is chosen, you can use the attribute lvl with numbers from 0 to 8 to explicitly specify the text style level. The numbering starts with 0, which corresponds to the first text style level. Therefore, 1 refers to the second level and so forth. From the paragraph properties of the specified text style level think-cell uses the font color for text in labels and text boxes. Example: The default properties for a run of text in labels and text boxes. It is possible to override the primary and alternative font color from the values derived from the Power Point color scheme. You can specify the primary font color using solidfill Ref and the alternative font color using solidfill Ref Alt. For each label the best color to maximize contrast with the label background is chosen automatically. Example: Using def R Pr is a last resort. It is always preferable to change your template with regard to slide background and theme colors. Next you should set the correct text style level formatting in the slide master body text placeholder. Only if this is not possible or does not yield the desired result, use the lvl attribute of def P Pr described above and if that still does not yield the desired result, use def R Pr to explicitly define text colors. Some of the circumstances that require using def R Pr also require explicitly specifying the actual chart background color using solidfill Ref Background (see D.3.8 Chart background color).D.7 Predefining slide layouts for placing charts The optional element fixed Layout Lst has one or more fixed Layout elements as child elements that define a slide layout with one or more rectangular areas where Gantt, Pie/Doughnut, or all other charts can be placed. The predefined slide layouts will be shown as thumbnails in the top left corner of the slide view area when the corresponding type of chart is selected for insertion, or when dragging such a chart on the slide. Clicking into one of the rectangular areas in the slide thumbnail, or dropping the chart there, will place the chart at that position with that size. Defines a slide layout. Has one or more rect elements as child elements that define rectangular areas on the slide. Must have a for attribute, with admissible values:\"pie\"Defines a slide layout for placing Pie/Doughnut charts.\"gantt\"Defines a slide layout for placing Gantt charts/timelines.\"chart\"Defines a slide layout for placing all other charts. or a combination of these separated by spaces. Defines a rectangular area on a slide. Has four required attributes: l, t, r, and b. These define the position of the left, top, right and bottom edges of the area. Admissible values of these attributes are: absolute positions, specified as a whole number (e.g. \"360000\", \"+120000\", or \"-240000\") in EMU (12700 EMU = 1 pt, 360000 EMU = 1cm, 914400 EMU = 1 in) relative positions in terms of the slide size, specified as a decimal number immediately followed by a percent sign (e.g. \"10%\" or \"12.1%\") a combination of these conjoined with a + or -, starting with a relative position (e.g. \"10%+1800000\" or \"92.1%-1270000\").  The coordinate origin is in the top left corner of the slide, with positive direction to the right horizontally, and downwards vertically. For combinations of relative and absolute positions, the absolute part specifies an offset from the position specified relative to the slide size. For example, \"10%+1800000\" horizontally (as l or r) defines the horizontal position that is 10% of the horizontal slide size plus 1800000 EMU (= 5 cm) to the right of the left edge of the slide, and \"92.1%-1270000\" vertically (as t or b) defines the vertical position 1270000 EMU (= 100 pt) upwards of the position on the slide that is 92.1% of the vertical slide size downwards from the top edge of the slide or, equivalently, 7.9% (= 100% − 92.1%) of the vertical slide size plus 100 pt upwards from its bottom edge. Example: This defines a rectangular area having a 10% margin to the edge of the slide at the top and bottom, and a 3 cm (= 1080000 EMU) margin to the left edge and to the horizontal center of the slide. Example: This defines a slide layout with two predefined areas for inserting charts other than Gantt charts, both with 10% margins at the top and the bottom, the left one with 3 cm margins to the left edge and to the horizontal center of the slide, and the right one with a 3 cm margin to the horizontal center and to the right edge of the slide. It will be displayed like this in the top left corner of the slide view when selecting such a chart for insertion:    Clicking into one of the areas in the slide thumbnail will insert the chart with that position and size. It will also be shown when an existing chart is dragged, and dropping it in one of the areas will place it at that position and size. Example: This defines two slide layouts, the first being the one from the last example, for all charts except Gantt charts, and the second being a layout only for inserting Pie or Doughnut charts, with one area for insertion in the middle third of the slide horizontally, and with a 5 cm margin at the top, and a 3 cm margin at the bottom. When inserting or dragging a Pie or Doughnut chart, they will be displayed like this:   D.8 Customizing labels The element label contains elements customizing properties of labels. The following elements are child elements of label. Note that shapestyle Ref Bubble is a mandatory child element, whereas the other elements are optional. The line style used for the line between a segment label and the segment when the label is not placed inside the segment. If solidfill Ref is not specified, instead of using the color from lnfill Default, think-cell uses the color matching the automatically set label font color. Example: A reference to a shape defined in the shapestyle Lst. The attribute name must match the value of the same attribute in the shape style definition. It defines the style of labels by default used on level and total difference, and CAGR arrows. Example: The position of total labels. The attribute val can have the following values (the positions are described for upright column charts and change correspondingly for rotated or flipped charts): according To Sign Places total labels above the column for positive total values and below the column for negative total values. This is the default if the element is not present. away From Baseline Places total labels away from the baseline, i.e., the label is never placed between the column and the baseline. The setting applies to floating columns in waterfall charts. Otherwise, both methods result in identical labels positions and sum Label Position is not relevant. Example:D.9 Customizing lines D.9.1 lnfill Default The default line type used throughout think-cell. Using a ln Ref element to reference one of the lines in the ln Lst element the dash type and weight is defined. One of the solid colors in the fill Lst element is referenced using solidfill Ref to set the color. Example: If either the ln Ref or the solidfill Ref element is missing from one of the line style definitions below, the respective value from lnfill Default is used. The gridline style. It follows the same schema and rules as lnfill Default above.D.9.2 Segment outlines The outlines of segments are defined on the fill scheme level, i.e., every scheme from the color scheme control can also set a line style for segment outlines. The following elements are therefore child elements of a fill Scheme element. The default outline style for this color scheme. The outline style for Mekko charts using the parent element’s color scheme. If omitted, the line style from lnfill Segment is used. Here, no Line is used for segment outlines. However, as this is often not appropriate for Mekko charts, these use a thin solid line with the standard foreground color.D.9.3 Lines in charts The element chart contains elements customizing lines in charts. The following elements are child elements of the element chart. The default chart axis line style. The category axis line style. Can be used to set a thicker baseline weight. If omitted, lnfill Axis is used. The default line style used for difference arrows. The line style used for CAGR arrows. The line style used for total difference arrows. The line style used for level difference arrows. The line style used for extension lines of level difference arrows. The line style used for connector lines. The line style used for waterfall connector lines. If specified, the style overrides lnfill Connector. In addition to child elements ln Ref and solidfill Ref, lnfill Connector Waterfall also supports a child element of <no Line /> to specify that waterfall connectors should not be visible, which is not possibly for lnfill Connector. The line style used for value lines. The line style used for trendlines. The line style used for partitions. The line style used for error bars. The line style used for the Mekko chart ridge.D.9.4 Lines in the legend The following element is a child element of the element legend. The outline of the think-cell shape. When this element is not used, the shape has no outline. If the element is used, but only specifies the line style or the color, the property left unspecified is set by lnfill Default as usual. Example:D.10 Customizing Harvey ball and checkbox D.10.1 harveyball A combined style for the Harvey ball consisting of the child elements fill Ref Completed, fill Ref Background, and lnfill to describe the color of the completion state and, the background color and the outline of the Harvey ball respectively. The required attribute sz defines the default font size of the Harvey ball in one hundredth of a point. Example:D.10.2 fill Ref Completed See fill Ref.D.10.3 fill Ref Background See fill Ref.D.10.4 checkbox A combined style for the Checkbox consisting of the child element fill Ref to describe the background color of the Checkbox, the child element lnfill to describe the Checkbox’s outline and the list of symbols, characters and pictures in the child element choices. The required attribute sz defines the default font size of the Checkbox in one hundredth of a point. The size of each glyph has to be defined separately. Example:D.10.5 choices A list of choices to be used in a checkbox. The list can contain any number of the elements glyph for characters and symbols and pic for pictures.D.10.6 glyph A glyph (character or symbol) that is used as one of the choices of a checkbox. The attribute hotkeys describes a list of hotkey characters that select the glyph. The child elements solid Fill Ref describes the color of the character or symbol, font its font and t the character or symbol itself. The required attribute sz defines the default font size of the character in one hundredth of a point, independent from the checkbox’s total size. Example:D.10.7 t A character or symbol used in a glyph (itself used in a checkbox). The contents of this element can be a verbatim character (a), a Unicode symbol or a numeric character reference to a Unicode code point. The numeric reference can be given using decimal numbers (&#10007;) or hexadecimal numbers (&#x2717;).D.10.8 pic A picture that is used as one of the choices of a checkbox. The file name of an EMF file with the picture is given as the attribute Target of the child element Relationship. The attribute hotkeys describes a list of hotkey characters that select the picture. Example: To create an EMF file of any shape in Power Point:  Right-click the shape or selection of shapes.  Choose Save as Picture.  Make sure to save as type Enhanced Windows Metafile (*.emf).  Of course, you can also use a suitable graphics editor to create an EMF file.D.11 Customizing Gantt charts D.11.1 gantt Determines the default appearance and formatting options of Gantt charts.

Optional child element: lnfill: Determines the style and color for all milestone lines. Follows the schema of the local lnfill Default. When not present, (local, if available) lnfill Default is used. Example:Result:    D.11.2 fiscal Year An optional element that, when included, adds the Fiscal Year option in the floating toolbar of the Gantt chart. Must have either one start or one end child element. Optionally has a week Alignment child element.  When the Fiscal Year option is enabled for a Gantt chart, its year scale displays fiscal years (indicated by a default \"FY\" prefix) instead of calendar years, which start or end with the month specified in the corresponding child element of the same calendar year. If there is a week Alignment child element, the 52-53-week convention is used: Each fiscal year ends on the same weekday as specified in the last Weekday attribute, with leap weeks inserted appropriately. Which calendar date on which the specified weekday falls represents the last day of a fiscal year is determined by the last Day attribute. Quarters are displayed as consisting of exactly 13 weeks, except for Q4 of a leap week year, which consists of exactly 14 weeks. If the optional weeks Per Month attribute of the week Alignment element is set, the months displayed also always end on the specified weekday, using the convention given in this attribute to determine how to distribute weeks onto months. The leap week is always added to the last month of Q4. Example: When a style file containing this element is loaded and the Fiscal Year option is enabled for a Gantt chart, the FY 2023 displayed on its year scale would end on the Friday closest to 01/31/2023, namely 02/03/2023, and FY 2024 would begin on 02/04/2023. The middle month of each 13-week quarter would consist of 5 weeks, the other two of 4 weeks. FY2023 would be a leap week year, with Q4 2023 being a 14-week quarter and its last two months, December and January of FY 2023, consisting of 5 weeks (11/26/2022–30/12/2022 and 12/31/2022–03/02/2023). Required child element. Specifies the start or end of a fiscal year. Has one required attribute month, with admissible values: \"jan\", \"feb\", \"mar\", \"apr\", \"may\", \"jun\", \"jul\", \"aug\", \"sep\", \"oct\", \"nov\", \"dec\". Optional child element. Specifies which weekday is the last of a fiscal year using the 52-53-week convention, how the calendar date that ends a fiscal year is determined, and whether months should also end on the specified weekday and if so how weeks are distributed onto months. Has two required attributes last Weekday and last Day, and one optional attribute weeks Per Month: The weekday on which each fiscal year ends. Admissible values: \"sun\", \"mon\", \"tue\", \"wed\", \"thu\", \"fri\", \"sat\". How the calendar date for the last day of the fiscal year is chosen. Admissible values: \"in Last Month\" The last day of the fiscal year is the last weekday of the specified kind that lies within the calendar month specified in the end element (or the calendar month before the one specified in the start element). \"nearest To End Of Last Month\" The last day of the fiscal year is the weekday of the specified kind that is closest to the end of the calendar month specified in the end element (or the calendar month before the one specified in the start element). Note: Using the \"nearest To End Of Last Month\" setting may lead to the end of the fiscal year falling outside the calendar month specified in the end element (inside the calendar month specified in the start element), as seen in the above example. When using \"in Last Month\" the end of the fiscal year is always in the calendar month specified in the end element (in the calendar month before the one specified in the start element). If set, months also end on the specified weekday. Its value determines the convention to use for distributing weeks onto months. Admissible values: \"544\" The first month of each 13-week quarter has 5 weeks, and the other two 4. \"454\" The middle month of each 13-week quarter has 5 weeks, and the other two 4. \"445\" The last month of each 13-week quarter has 5 weeks, and the other two 4.Introduction   1.

Discover your library and new tools. 22. Excel data links        Resources     Manual    Excel data links   When the source data for your data-driven charts is available in Excel, you can create charts directly from the Excel application. When data in Excel changes, you can either update the charts on command or have think-cell do the update automatically.Contents22.1 Creating a chart from Excel Let\\'s say you want to recreate the example chart from 4. Introduction to charting, but instead of entering the data into the internal datasheet in Power Point, you want to use it directly from an Excel sheet. This is how the data looks in Excel:    To create the chart from Excel, select the desired data range in your Excel workbook, including series (in our example empty) and category labels:    The range we selected in our example perfectly fits the default datasheet of a Stacked Column chart, with rows representing series, columns representing categories, category labels in the first row, a second row where a value representing 100% would go, and a first column where series labels would go. This is the easiest case, as a link will initially be created using the default data layout for the selected chart type. But it is not strictly necessary, as the interpretation of a linked range of cells can be modified as explained in 22.2 Fitting the data layout. Now select the desired chart type, in our case a Stacked Column chart, from the Link To Power Point menu in Excel’s think-cell toolbar:    When you click on this menu item in Excel, the Power Point window is activated. If Power Point is not yet running, it starts automatically. In Power Point, when the mouse pointer is on a slide, the familiar insertion rectangle appears. Switch to the slide where you want to insert the chart, or insert a new slide, and place the chart as usual: Click once to accept the default size or click, hold and drag to change the chart’s initial size. For a detailed description on how to place, resize and align a new chart, please refer to 4.1 Inserting a new chart. After insertion, the chart looks and behaves like a regular think-cell chart that has been created in Power Point. The Excel workbook containing the linked data will be indicated on top of the chart:    Please refer to 4.2 Adding and removing labels and 4.4 Styling the chart to learn how to configure and style the chart. Note: If you use colored cell backgrounds in Excel, you can set those as the segment fill color in the linked chart by enabling Use Datasheet Fill on Top in the chart’s color scheme control (see 3.4.2 Color scheme). This can be especially powerful when you combine it with Excel’s conditional formatting. As well as creating a new chart, you can link a selected data range in your Excel workbook to an existing chart in a Power Point presentation. Simply click the     \\xa0To Existing Element button from the Link To Power Point menu in Excel’s think-cell toolbar and click on the chart in Power Point that you wish to link to.22.2 Fitting the data layout Having linked a data range to a chart, you can alter how the data is interpreted using the    Edit Data Layout and     Transpose Link buttons in the think-cell context menu of the data range. By editing the data layout, you can remove unneeded or unwanted special rows and columns from the data range, as explained in more detail in 5.5 Edit data layout. Returning to the example above, since we did not have series labels, we can avoid including an empty first column in our data range when inserting the chart as follows:  Select only the data columns plus category labels (H1:K4 in our example).  Select the desired chart type from the Link To Power Point menu (Stacked Column in our example) and insert it on the slide as described above.  Select the green border of the data range in Excel, and right-click it to open the context menu.  Select     Edit Data Layout.  Click the checkbox at Series Labels to disable the column in the data range.  Click the green flag on the chart in Power Point to update (see 22.3 Updating a linked element).  Our linked range in Excel now looks like this, giving the same resulting chart as pictured above:    Transposing a data range swaps the chart’s row and column data interpretation, letting you, for example, create column charts from rows rather than columns of data.  Select the green border of the data range in Excel, and right-click it to open the context menu.  Select     \\xa0Transpose Link.  Click the green flag on the chart in Power Point to update (see 22.3 Updating a linked element).    Again, the resulting chart will be the same as pictured above. Note: Transposing a linked data range does not swap the data in the rows and columns.22.3 Updating a linked element The most important function of a chart that is linked to an Excel workbook is the option to update the chart according to changes in the underlying data. In our example, we want to add a third data series. Double-click the chart to switch to the linked data range in Excel. If the linked workbook is not open, think-cell will attempt to open it from the location it had when the link was last established, shown on top of the chart. If this fails, the internal datasheet will be opened instead, and the chart will behave like an ordinary think-cell chart. See 22.7.1 Editing linked files for more detail. Enter the additional data below the linked range:    Then, select the linked range by clicking on its border to show the familiar think-cell user interface. Drag a corner of the selection to include the newly entered data:      Finally, return to Power Point. When selecting the linked chart, it is flagged to indicate that an update of its linked data has been detected:      Click the flag or the     \\xa0Update Once button in the chart\\'s floating toolbar, which is also marked with the green flag, to incorporate the data changes from Excel in the chart. The chart is updated and the flag disappears:    After updating, the     button is highlighted in the floating toolbar and does not show a green flag; its tooltip has changed to Updated. This indicates that the data shown in the chart is up-to-date with the linked Excel range. Click the     \\xa0Revert button to take back the changes you just made. Now this button will be highlighted, with its tooltip saying Reverted indicating that the data shown in the chart is in the state before the latest update was made. think-cell will store the state of the data before and after the latest update in the element in Power Point until you close the presentation. You can use the     and     buttons to switch between these \"most recent\" and \"previous\" states of the data, even when you have already closed the linked Excel sheet. Note: The green flag     indicates that there is a difference between the linked Excel range and both the \"most recent\" and the \"previous\" state of the data stored in the element in Power Point. The linked Excel file must be open for this indication to be available. Clicking the flag, or the    Update Once button decorated with it, stores the state of the linked Excel range as \"most recent\" in the element in Power Point, and the state displayed in the element before clicking it as \"previous\". Even if the chart is not updated, or is updated and then reverted again, the link to the Excel data source remains. Thus, you always have the option to update the chart later. You can also let think-cell automatically update the linked chart for you whenever the linked Excel range changes. To do so, simply click the    Update Automatically button. For this to work, the presentation containing the chart and the Excel workbook containing the linked data must be open simultaneously. To disable automatic updates again click    Disable Automatic Update. Note: Linking a chart to data in Excel using think-cell does not depend on the file names of the Excel or Power Point file. Each chart as well as each data range in Excel is assigned a unique identification number that is used to maintain the link. The technical requirement for reestablishing a link is that both the Excel file containing the data range and the Power Point file containing the chart are simultaneously open on the same computer, irrespective of the file names. As mentioned above, think-cell will, however, remember the location of the Excel file last opened containing a matching linked range, and will attempt to open that workbook when double-clicking the chart, falling back to the internal datasheet when it cannot be found at that location.22.4 Creating a table from Excel In addition to charts you can also link a data range in Excel to a table in Power Point:  Select the desired data range in your Excel workbook, including column and row headers.  Choose     \\xa0Table from the Link to Power Point menu in Excel’s think-cell toolbar.  Place the data table on the slide.  The table in Power Point can be resized, positioned and formatted as described in 17. Tables. In particular, many aspects of the formatting applied in Excel can be automatically carried over to Power Point, as described in 17.3 Formatting a table. If you want to include both a chart and a data table on a slide in Power Point, you can create them based on the same data range in Excel as described in 22.1 Creating a chart from Excel above for the chart and described in this section for the table.    In this case the table was placed below the chart, so that the chart\\'s category labels also function as the column headers for the table. When selecting the linked range for the table, only the series labels and data values were included to achieve this. A linked table is updated in the same way as a linked chart, as explained in 22.3 Updating a linked element. When any cell of a linked table is selected in Power Point, you can choose between manual and automatic updates or revert the last update. The linked table is also included in the Data Links dialog described in 22.6 Data Links dialog.22.5 Creating Text Linked to Excel You can also insert a text field that is linked to a cell in Excel into any think-cell label or Power Point text box. In Excel, select the cell with the content you wish to link to. In Power Point, place the cursor in a label or text box. Choose     Text Linked to Excel from think-cell\\'s Elements menu in Power Point.  The green flag does not appear on top of a text field when an update is available, but is only shown on the Update button in its floating toolbar. Otherwise, managing updates to the content of the text field works exactly as explained in 22.3 Updating a linked element.22.6 Data Links dialog If you have a large number of linked elements in your presentation, finding and updating all of them manually is not practical. For a better overview and a more directed approach to update your elements, go to the    Tools menu in the think-cell toolbar in Power Point and open the Data Links dialog:    The data links dialog shows all linked elements in the presentation on slide thumbnails. An element is marked by the green flag     when an update is pending. The linked Excel file must be open for this indication to be available. It is marked with     if it is set to update automatically. You can also enable Highlight on Slide in order to additionally highlight linked elements on the slide; the Highlight Links button enables this from the Ribbon. In a second column is a list of the Excel files and Tableau UR Ls (see 24. Tableau data) that are the linked data\\'s sources. Each source is shown next to the first slide with an element linked to it.    When hovering over a linked element in the slide thumbnail:  The source of the linked data is highlighted in the right column.  The tooltip also shows the source of the data, the element\\'s update state, and when its data was last modified.  Click an element on the slide thumbnail to select it; Power Point will also switch to the element (in Normal view) or the slide containing it (in Slide Sorter view). You can then control its update state and behavior using the    Update Once,    Revert, and    Update Automatically buttons in the right column as explained in 22.3 Updating a linked element or the    Update Manually button for elements linked to Tableau (see 24. Tableau data). For ways of selecting and controlling more than one element see 22.6.1 Multi-selection and filtering below. When think-cell has not yet compared the data displayed in the linked element with a linked range in Excel since the presentation containing the element has been opened, an orange question mark     is shown in front of the file name and on the    Reverted or the    Automatic Update Enabled button when an element linked to such a file is selected, depending on whether the element is set to manual or automatic update. The orange question mark indicates that the file name and location shown is merely the location of the workbook when the data was last updated; think-cell does not yet know whether it is still available in that location, and whether or not the data displayed is up-to-date. In both cases, you can attempt to update the element with the data from the workbook shown in the right column without opening it in Excel, by clicking one of the       Update buttons. If the file is found at its last known location, the data displayed is updated, the orange question mark     disappears and the element is set to manual or automatic update, depending on which button you clicked. If the file, or the linked range within it, cannot be found, the update fails and a red exclamation mark     is shown on the linked element, in front of the file name in the right column, and on the    Reverted or the    Automatic Update Enabled button. For more details see 22.7.1 Editing linked files.                                  Double-clicking an element on the slide thumbnails has the same effect as a double-click on the element itself: The source of the data is opened. For elements linked to Excel, the linked range will be selected on the sheet. If the Excel workbook is unavailable, the internal datasheet is opened instead. You can leave the data link dialog open while you continue editing your slides and data. Note: If the linked Excel file for an element is not available, and the internal datasheet is opened and edited, then automatic updating for the linked element will be disabled. This ensures that any changes made using the internal datasheet are not automatically overwritten when the linked Excel file becomes available.22.6.1 Multi-selection and filtering There are various ways of selecting more than one linked element:  Click a file in the right column to select all elements linked to that file.  Click into an empty area on a slide thumbnail to select all linked elements on that slide.  Ctrl-click to select multiple elements individually. You can also Ctrl-click files to add all elements linked to that file to the selection.  Ctrl-click multiple slides to select all elements on the selected slides.  Use Shift to select a range of slides and all charts on them or a range of files and all elements linked to them. Use Ctrl+A or click Select All to select all linked elements in the presentation.  You can then control the update state and behavior of all selected elements simultaneously via the buttons in the right column. Note: You will only be offered the buttons that can actually be applied to all selected elements. This means that when your selection contains an element linked to Tableau (see 24. Tableau data), only the    Update Manually button will be shown. Clicking it will have the same effect on the selected links to Excel as the    Update Once button. Use the Filter Selection checkboxes to narrow down your selection by excluding linked elements that are already     Updated have been     Reverted or have a pending update have     Automatic Update Enabled are     Manual Update Only because they are linked to Tableau (see 24. Tableau data).    You can click a checkbox again to reinclude all linked elements of the corresponding type that were part of the original selection. Note: To select only linked elements of a given state or type, first click Select All and then remove all other types from the selection.22.7 Maintaining data links After the creation of a link between Excel data and a chart in Power Point, both Excel and Power Point files continue to be self-contained independent files:  You can pass on or edit the files independently.  You can rename the files. The data links will be reestablished as soon as the Excel and Power Point files are open at the same time. To store the information about the reestablished data links the files should be saved.  You can copy and paste linked charts within the same presentation or even to another presentation. The copy of the chart will then be linked to the same data source as the original.  You can send the Excel and Power Point files by email. The data links will be reestablished as soon as the Excel and Power Point files are open at the same time on the computer of the receiver. To store the information about the reestablished data links the files should be saved.  You can make copies of linked Excel files and use the copies as alternative data sources for the data links. The original and copied Excel files can be independently edited. The link between a Power Point presentation and the desired Excel file will be established when opening one of either the original or the copied Excel files together with the Power Point file.  Note: When copies of the same linked range in Excel are present in open workbooks, e.g., after copying a worksheet, both copies are equally valid source ranges (\"siblings\") and it is undefined with which range the link will be established when opening the Power Point file. Small numbered tabs that can be used to switch between them are shown on all sibling Excel ranges.    You should make all but one copy of the linked range unavailable, e.g. by closing workbooks containing a copy of the link. Alternatively, you can make all the linked ranges unique by deleting all but one of the think-cell frames in Excel and creating new links to the desired elements using the     \\xa0To Existing Element button from the Link To Power Point menu. This way, each new range is assigned a unique identifier.22.7.1 Editing linked files If you edit the Power Point file without the linked Excel file(s) being available, linked elements simply behave as regular elements with an internal datasheet. Using think-cell, you can change the element’s design and data without any restrictions. Note: Linked text fields (see 22.5 Creating Text Linked to Excel) are the exception here, since they do not have an internal datasheet. If you want to change the text simply delete the text field and enter the text manually. This will break the link. Similarly, you can freely edit an Excel workbook without the linked Power Point file(s) being available. With think-cell installed, any linked data ranges that are not currently connected to an open Power Point presentation are highlighted with a light red frame. When a Power Point presentation containing a linked element is opened without a matching linked range being open in Excel, that element is marked with an orange question mark     in front of the file path displayed on top of it when selected and in the 22.6 Data Links dialog. When the element is set to automatic update, the orange question mark will also appear on the    Automatic Update Enabled button, otherwise on the    Reverted button. The orange question mark indicates that the file name and location shown is merely the location the workbook had when the element was last updated from the linked range contained in it; think-cell does not yet know whether it is still available in that location, whether the workbook still contains a linked range and whether or not the data displayed is up-to-date with it. You can click one of the       Update buttons to initiate a background update. think-cell will attempt to open the workbook from its last recorded location in the background, compare the contents of the linked range with the data displayed in the element in Power Point, and update it if necessary. If this succeeds, the orange question mark disappears and the element is set to manual or automatic update depending on which of the Update buttons you clicked.                                  If the update fails, either because the source file cannot be opened or does not contain a matching linked range anymore, a red exclamation mark     is shown in place of the orange question mark. Its tooltip will indicate the reason why the update did not succeed. You can then try to locate the file containing the matching range, and either open it to reestablish the connection, or place it at the location indicated on top of the element or in the Data Links dialog and click one of the Update buttons again to retry the background update. Note: Once the orange question mark or red exclamation mark has disappeared, either because an Excel file containing a matching linked range has been opened or a background update has succeeded, it is not possible to initiate a background update again by clicking the Update buttons. Moreover, think-cell will not monitor the linked range in the Excel file for changes when it is not open in Excel, even if the element is set to update automatically. If you want to be sure that the data contained in the linked Excel workbook and in the presentation correspond, it is therefore best to keep the workbook open in Excel. As soon as you open both the data source in Excel and the presentation containing the linked element in Power Point at the same time, the link is reestablished. In Excel, the highlight of the linked data range changes from red to green. In Power Point, the element’s current data is compared to the data source. If the element is set to    Update Automatically, any changes to the data are immediately applied. Otherwise, if changes are detected, the element is flagged     when selected and in the 22.6 Data Links dialog. You can then control the update as explained in 22.3 Updating a linked element.22.7.2 Changing and removing links To disconnect a chart or table from its linked data source, simply select the button    Break Excel Link from the element’s context menu:    From that point on, the element only uses the think-cell datasheet in Power Point. Note: Linked text fields (see 22.5 Creating Text Linked to Excel) do not have a context menu. To break a linked text field\\'s link, select it in the 22.6 Data Links dialog and press Del. Similarly, you can disconnect a linked data range in Excel from its elements: Select the linked range by clicking on its frame. When the frame turns blue, indicating a think-cell selection, right-click on it and select the    Delete button. The think-cell frame is removed while the data itself remains untouched. Any linked elements will no longer be able to connect to this data range as their data source, and will instead use their internal datasheets. Note: You cannot undo the removal of a linked frame, but you can create a new link with an existing element, when you need it (see below). If you remove one participant of a link, either the data range in Excel or the linked element in Power Point, the other side does not get deleted with it. In particular, linked data ranges in Excel simply remain in place until they are explicitly removed. This is important, because there may be other charts in other presentations linking to the same data source. Note: If you want to remove all data links from a presentation, use the 22.6 Data Links dialog. In the dialog, click Select All and then press the Del key to remove all such links in a single step. If you want to delete all disconnected data links in an open Excel workbook, select Delete Disconnected Links from the    Tools menu in Excel, or right-click a linked range highlighted in red and select    Delete All Disconnected Data Links from the contextual menu. The red highlighting indicates that the linked range is disconnected, i.e. that it is not connected to any think-cell element in a currently open Power Point presentation. If you want to link an existing element to an Excel data source, first go to the Excel workbook and select the desired data range. You can also select an existing linked range, indicated by the colored think-cell selection frame. Then select     \\xa0To Existing Element from the Link To Power Point menu. Power Point will come into focus; simply click the desired element on the slide to link it to the selected Excel range. Note: If the selected element is already linked to an external data source, the newly created link will overwrite the previous link. Alternatively, with the desired Excel range selected, switch to Power Point and select the desired element. If the element is already linked to some other data source, disconnect it as described above. Now the Excel link button in the element’s context menu has changed to     \\xa0Establish Excel Link. Click this button to establish a link from the selected element in Power Point to the selected data range in Excel. Note: Linked text fields are the exception here. They cannot be linked to a different cell after they have been created.22.8 How to compile the data When creating charts directly from Excel, you probably already have your data in Excel. In some cases, however, you may not wish to create a chart using all the data you have in your Excel sheet. Alternatively, the data may be in a fixed format that can not be easily altered. As explained in 22.2 Fitting the data layout you can modify the interpretation of the linked range to better fit your data layout. Sometimes, these possibilities may still not be enough. Here are a few suggestions that may help you in such situations:  Place the think-cell data link frame in an empty area on your Excel worksheet. Then use Excel’s cell references to populate the think-cell frame with data from elsewhere on the worksheet. E.g., enter =B5 in cell F8 to update F8 whenever B5 changes.  Excel cell references also work across worksheets. Adding a dedicated worksheet as an interface sheet for all charts can be helpful in particular if you have many charts to link.  Using a dedicated sheet as the source for your charts also helps to prepare the data specifically for the intended purpose. For example, you can use think-cell round to consistently round the data before presenting it in a chart (see 23.2 Excel data rounding).  You can simply hide entire rows or columns of data from being reflected in the chart by using Excel’s Hide command. Keep in mind that the hidden data will appear in the chart as soon as you use Excel’s Unhide command and update the chart.  Similarly, you can use Excel’s Group and Outline function to hide data that you do not want to be shown in the chart.     22.9 Frequently asked questions22.9.1 What happens when copying a linked element? You can copy a linked element just like any other by duplicating a slide, duplicating the element, Ctrl-dragging the element or copy-pasting the element to another slide or to another presentation. In fact, even making a copy of the presentation file is a way to copy a contained linked element. In any case, the original and the copy are indistinguishable. Both link to the same Excel data range and, if they are open simultaneously, both will receive an update when Excel data changes.22.9.2 What happens when a linked element is deleted? When you delete a linked element, the link in Power Point is removed along with it. If there is no other element in an open presentation linking to the same Excel data range, the frame in Excel turns from green to red, indicating that the link cannot be established. The linked data range in Excel is not affected in any other way by the deletion of a linked element. After all, it is possible that a copy of the linked element has been made, which, when opened, should reestablish its link.22.9.3 How can I get rid of the red frames in my Excel worksheets? Different colored frames in the Excel worksheets indicate linked data ranges. A green frame indicates that a link has been established between the framed data range and an element in an open Power Point presentation. In contrast, a red frame indicates that no presentation containing a linked element is currently open. A red frame does not necessarily mean that there are no elements at all linking to that data range. It just means that in the currently open presentations there are no such elements. If you are sure that the framed data range is no longer required as a data source for any elements, you can remove the frame with the     \\xa0Delete button from the context menu. Together with the frame, the link information is removed from the Excel workbook. Any elements that are linked to the concerned Excel data range will not be able to establish their links in the future. Instead, they will use their internal datasheets. The Excel data itself is not affected.22.9.4 How can I see which elements in a presentation are linked, and where their linked data sources are? If you are unsure about the data sources of the elements in a presentation, go to the    Tools menu and open the Data Links dialog. The dialog shows a list of all slides in the presentation containing linked elements and indicates their position on the slide. An element is marked with     if it is set to update automatically. The file name of the Excel file where the linked data range was last found is shown as well, and will be highlighted when hovering over or selecting the element linked to it. For a detailed description refer to section 22.6 Data Links dialog.22.9.5 What happens to a linked element when its data source is unavailable? When the Excel workbook that contains an element’s linked data range is not open and cannot be found in the same file location where it used to be, the element cannot establish its link. Instead, it will use its internal datasheet, which always contains a copy of the linked data, and allows you to change the data the element is based on. The internal datasheet of a linked element is similar to that of a regular element. In particular, even if there are multiple elements linked to the same Excel range, their internal datasheets are independent. If you want to reestablish the link to the Excel data range, simply open the Excel workbook and the presentation with the linked element at the same time. The chart in Power Point and the data in Excel will then automatically connect. When updating the element with the linked data, any changes you made to the data in the internal datasheet will be overwritten.22.9.6 How can I use the internal datasheet instead of the linked Excel data source? To disconnect an element from its linked data source, use the     \\xa0Break Excel Link button from its context menu. From now on, the element only uses the think-cell datasheet in Power Point. You can remove the link from an element, whether the linked Excel data range is currently open or not. For the Excel side of the data link, breaking the link of an element has the same effect as removing the element. For further information read section 22.7.2 Changing and removing links.22.9.7 How can I enable or disable auto-updating? To enable automatic updating, select the linked element and click    Update Automatically in the floating toolbar. To disable it again click    Disable Automatic Update. For a detailed description of controlling update behavior see 22.3 Updating a linked element. The same options are available via the 22.6 Data Links dialog.22.9.8 Why is my linked element not updating although it is set to auto-update? The Power Point side and the Excel side of a data link can only connect when both files are open at the same time. Therefore, when the data in Excel is changed while the Power Point presentation is not open, and then the presentation is opened without the Excel workbook being open at the same time, the linked elements will not detect the changes in their data sources. As soon as the Excel workbook containing the linked data range is open, the link will be established and the changes will be detected. If the element is set to auto-update, it will update now. Otherwise, the element will be flagged when selected as well as in the 22.6 Data Links dialog. You can then decide whether you want to incorporate the changed data into the element or not. For more information read section 22.3 Updating a linked element.22.9.9 Why is my linked element indicating a pending update although the data in Excel did not change? Whenever a link is established between an open Power Point presentation and an open Excel workbook, the data from the internal datasheet is compared to the linked data range. If they are not the same, the element is flagged to indicate that an update is due. If auto-update is enabled, it is updated immediately. A pending update may also be detected when the data in the Excel workbook is unchanged, but the data in the internal datasheet has been modified. For a linked element, the linked Excel data range takes priority over the internal datasheet. Therefore, an update will always overwrite any changes in the internal datasheet. To protect you against data loss, whenever you make changes in the internal datasheet of a linked element, auto-update is disabled for the concerned element. For a detailed description of update behavior and controlling it read section 22.3 Updating a linked element.22.9.10 How can I link an existing element to a data range in an Excel workbook? Go to the Excel workbook and select the desired range. Then select     \\xa0To Existing Element from the Link To Power Point menu. Power Point will come into focus; simply click the desired element on the slide to link it to the selected Excel range. Alternatively, after selecting the desired range in Excel, switch to Power Point, select and right-click the desired chart, and click the     \\xa0Establish Excel Link button in the context menu. For a detailed description, refer to section 22.7.2 Changing and removing links. To learn how to insert a chart directly from Excel, read section 22.1 Creating a chart from Excel.22.9.11 My linked chart seems to ignore part of the Excel data range. Why? In addition to the main data, the linked range in Excel by default contains some cells to the left and on top which are reserved for special rows and columns like category and series labels, or the 100%= row. If the selected range encloses only the main data, part of the data will be interpreted as labels etc. and will not show up in the chart. You can modify the linked range to not include these special rows and columns, as explained in 22.2 Fitting the data layout, or, if the layout of your Excel sheet permits it, you can enlarge the linked data range by dragging one of the handles at its corners so that your data is in the data cells of the linked range (see also 22.8 How to compile the data).22.9.12 Why is Excel slow when I have lots of linked data ranges? Excel performance can be improved by disabling automatic error checking. To do this, go to the dialog Excel Options, select Formulas and uncheck the box  Enable background error checking  in the section Error Checking.22.9.13 I have a lot of Excel files to visualize with think-cell. Can I run think-cell in batch mode? It is possible to program think-cell. think-cell offers functions to update charts with data from Excel ranges programmatically and to create entire presentations from templates, see 26. Automation with Excel data.22.9.14 What are the advantages over Microsoft OLE? You may be familiar with OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) in Microsoft Office. The idea is similar to think-cell’s linking, allowing the creation of charts in Power Point that can later be updated with data changes from Excel. However, think-cell’s linking technique has several advantages over OLE:  The charts are always the same, whether they are linked or not. Even linked charts are native Power Point objects, not Excel charts pasted into Power Point. In particular, the data on which the chart is based is also stored in the presentation and can be viewed and edited even if the file linked to is unavailable.  Charts can be linked to Excel at any time, not only when they are created.  Linked charts remain editable, even when the linked data source is not available.  Links in think-cell are independent of the file name or path. Simply open both files and any existing links between the files are reestablished. Introduction   1. Search in manual     2.

Discover your library and new tools. 7. Column, line, and area chart        Resources     Manual    Column, line, and area chart  Contents7.1 Column chart and stacked column chart Icon in Elements menu:      In think-cell, we do not distinguish between simple column charts and stacked column charts. If you want to create a simple column chart, enter only one series (row) of data in the datasheet. For a quick tour of the column chart, refer to the example in the chapter 4. Introduction to charting. Bar charts in think-cell are simply rotated column charts, and can be used exactly as column charts. In addition, you can create butterfly charts by placing two bar charts “back-to-back”. To do so, apply the functions rotation (see 3.5.2 Rotate and flip elements) and same scale (see 8.1.4 Same scale). Then remove the category labels for one of the charts.    For the steps to create a stacked clustered chart, see 7.2 Clustered chart. To change the column width, select a segment and drag one of the handles at half the height of the column.    The tooltip shows the resulting gap width while dragging. A larger column width results in a smaller gap width and vice versa, as the chart width is not altered when column widths are changed. The gap width is displayed as a percentage of the column width, i.e., a value of 50% means that each gap is half as wide as a column. Changing the column width for one column will change it for all other columns as well. All columns always have the same width. For a chart with variable column widths depending on your data, see 10. Mekko chart. To make individual gaps wider, see 8.1.7 Category gap.7.2 Clustered chart Icon in Elements menu:      The clustered chart is a variant of the stacked column chart, with the segments arranged side-by-side. A clustered chart can be combined with a line chart by selecting a segment of a series and choosing Line from the chart type control of this series. If you want to arrange stacks of segments side by side, you can create a stacked clustered chart.    To create a stacked clustered chart, follow these steps:  Insert a stacked chart.  Select a segment and drag the column width handle at half the height of the column until the tooltip shows 0% gap.  Click onto the baseline where you want to insert a category gap and drag the arrow to the right until the tooltip shows 1 Category Gap; this has to be repeated for all clusters.  If there is an even number of stacks in a cluster, the label cannot be centered to the whole cluster. Use a Power Point text box as a label in this case.7.3 100% chart Icon in Elements menu:    The 100% chart is a variation of a stacked column chart with all columns typically adding up to the same height (i.e., 100%). The labels of the 100% chart support the label content property, which lets you choose if you want to display absolute values, percentages, or both (6.5.5 Label content).    With think-cell, you can create 100% charts with columns that do not necessarily add up to 100%. If a column totals to more or less than 100%, it is rendered accordingly. For details about filling in the datasheet refer to 5.2 Absolute and relative values.7.4 Line chart Icon in Elements menu:      The line chart (also called a profile chart when rotated by 90°) uses lines to connect data points belonging to the same series. The appearance of the line chart is controlled by the line scheme, line style and marker shape controls in the floating toolbar. See 3.4 Format and style elements for details on these controls. Labels for the data points are not shown by default but may be displayed using the line chart     \\xa0Add Point Label context menu button. If the category values of a line chart are strictly increasing numbers or dates and can be interpreted as such according to the axis label number format, then the X-axis will automatically switch to a value axis (see 8.1.1 Value axis). When dates are used the date format can be changed by multi-selecting all category labels (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects) and typing a date format into the control (see 13.8 Date format codes). If you want to show more labels than would fit next to each other horizontally you can use label rotation (see 6.3.1 Label rotation). The X-axis can only switch from category to value mode if the following conditions are met:  All category cells in the datasheet contain numbers and Excel’s cell format is also set to General or Number or all category cells in the datasheet contain dates and Excel’s cell format is also set to Date.  The numbers or dates in the category cells are strictly increasing from left to right. The Y-axis is not set to Crosses Between Categories (see Positioning the value axis). If only this requirement is preventing a switch to the value axis mode, you can use    Make Value Axis from the axis context menu to switch to Crosses At Categories and thereby switch to the value axis mode as well. If the X-axis has been deleted, the data is displayed as for a category axis.The line chart can also display a second value Y-axis. Please refer to 8.1.6 Secondary Axis for further information. If Use Datasheet Fill on Top is selected (see 3.4.2 Color scheme), the fill color from Excel’s cell formatting is used in the following way:  The fill color of the cell containing the series name determines the line color.  The fill color of each data point’s cell determines the marker color for this data point. 7.4.1 Smoothed lines If you prefer a smoother appearance of the lines in a line chart, you can turn on this setting. First right-click on the desired line, then use the     \\xa0Set to Smooth Line button.7.4.2 Interpolation In line, area and area 100% charts, missing values are linearly interpolated by default. The     \\xa0Do not Interpolate button in a series' context menu can be used to disable interpolation, in which case missing values are represented as if they were 0. In line charts, interpolation can be enabled and disabled for individual series in a chart. In area charts, it can only be applied to the whole chart, because the series stack on each other.7.5 Error bars Error bars can be used to indicate deviations in the line and stacked chart. By means of the error bars the following chart can be created.    Create a line chart with three series. The first series reflects the upper deviation, the second series reflects the mean and the third series reflects the lower deviation.  Right-click the center line and choose     \\xa0Add Error Bars from the context menu.  Select one of the error bars to change the marker shape and color for the upper and lower deviation and the line type of the bar for all error bars. You can also select an individual error bar marker to change the properties for this marker only. A handle appears at each end when you select an error bar. You can drag these handles to select which lines the error bars should span. You can also visualize intervals instead of the deviation around a central value if you set the error bar to only span two adjacent lines.7.5.1 Football field chart Using a rotated line chart and error bars, you can also create football field charts. They can be used to visualize the low and high values for an item and the spread between them.   To create a football field chart: Create a line chart rotated to the right (a profile chart) Enter the low and high values in the datasheet   Select both the lines for low and high values Right-click and choose Add Error Bars from think-cell's context menu Select one error bar and format both the bar and data points for low and high values as desired. You would typically switch to a thick error bar, e.g., 6pt in football field charts. Right-click the chart background and select Add Gridlines from the context menu. To style all of them, select any one of them and press Ctrl+A to select all. You can then choose formatting options from the floating toolbar, such as a lighter color.  If your first data range is placed on top of the horizontal Y-axis, you can either modify the axis extent of the vertical axis (see 8.1.1 Value axis) or drag the Y-axis upwards. Note that in the latter case, the vertical axis will turn into a category axis, leading to data points being evenly spaced vertically instead of based on the numerical or date values in the category row. Using more than two series and by adding multiple error bars between pairs of them, more complex football field charts can be created. For example you could add a third series containing a mean, and add two differently colored error bars above and below it.7.6 Area and area 100% chart7.6.1 Area chart Icon in Elements menu:      An area chart can be thought of as a stacked line chart, with the data points representing the sum of the values in the categories rather than the individual values. The appearance of area charts is set using the color scheme control. Labels for the data points are not shown by default but may be displayed using the area chart     \\xa0Add Point Label context menu button. The area chart     \\xa0Add Total context menu button can be used to display total labels. Linear interpolation can be enabled using the     \\xa0Interpolate button (see 7.4.2 Interpolation). If Use Datasheet Fill on Top is selected (see 3.4.2 Color scheme), the Excel fill color of a series label cell determines the fill color of this series’ area.7.6.2 Area 100% chart Icon in Elements menu:      The area 100% chart is a variant of the area chart with the sum of all the values in a category typically representing 100%. If the values in a category total more or less than 100%, then the chart will be rendered accordingly. See 5.2 Absolute and relative values for more details about specifying data values. The labels of the area 100% chart can display absolute values, percentages, or both (6.5.5 Label content). Linear interpolation can be enabled using the     \\xa0Interpolate button (see 7.4.2 Interpolation).7.7 Combination chart Icon in Elements menu:      A combination chart combines line and column segments in a single chart. 7.4 Line chart and 7.1 Column chart and stacked column chart describe in detail the usage of lines and column segments in charts. To convert a line to a series of segments, simply highlight the line and select Stacked Segments from the chart type control (see 3.4.5 Chart type). To convert segments to a line, simply highlight a segment of the series and select the Line from the chart type control. The data sources of line charts, stacked charts and combination charts have the same format.    This function can be used in stacked and clustered column charts as well as in line charts.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3. Basic concepts   Charting   4.

Discover your library and new tools. 15. Text boxes        Resources     Manual    Text boxes   This chapter shows you how to work with think-cell’s text boxes to quickly create a complex slide layout like the example from 14. Introduction to layout:    In the following, you will learn how to work with think-cell’s text boxes how to insert, snap, duplicate, delete, move and change them to build your slide. Afterwards, we will recreate the example above with minimum effort using these actions. Of course, different or even more complex layouts are also possible, always relying on simple, meaningful actions defining the relations between elements and making manual placement and resizing unnecessary. Editing and formatting text in think-cell’s textboxes works just as it does in Power Point. It is important to note, however, that, when 15.8.3 Locking positions by default is disabled, think-cell’s text boxes differ from Power Point’s text boxes with regard to placement and layout. think-cell’s text boxes do not have a predefined, fixed size or position on the slide from the outset. Instead, they will adjust dynamically when you enter text, insert further elements or move existing ones. In this process, think-cell’s text boxes always maintain their relations to the other elements on the slide. think-cell will automatically position the elements on the slide evenly. This way, you do not have to manually readjust the size and position of every element after each change on the slide.Contents15.1 Inserting and snapping text boxes Let’s assume that you start from an empty slide. Let’s start with how to insert text boxes and snap them together:  Go to the think-cell group in the Power Point ribbon and click on    Text Box.  Click on the slide once to insert your first text box.    The box is automatically centered on the slide. Don’t worry if this isn’t the position you want the box to appear on your finalized slide. Its position and size will change as you build your slide, adapting dynamically to entered text or other elements on the slide.  Start typing to enter text.    Optionally, click into the box and use think-cell’s floating toolbar to add some fill color to it.    Insert another text box by clicking on the     \\xa0Text Box button again. When the mouse pointer is directly above, to the right, below or to the left of the existing box, you may snap the next text box to the existing box by clicking on one of the snap positions once.    The two boxes are now snapped together.    Snapped text boxes in think-cell have the advantage that they remain connected through all content and design changes. As you type in your text, the position of the boxes and their alignment is continuously readjusted.15.1.1 Snapping multiple text boxes You may have a slide that already has text boxes arranged in rows or columns, and you would like to insert another text box to form a table. When you insert the new box, you can decide to how many of the existing boxes it should snap:  Click on the    Text Box button on the ribbon.  Move the mouse cursor towards the row of text boxes on the slide. Note how the orange insertion frame changes depending on the mouse position.  If you move the mouse cursor close above the center of one of the boxes, the snap target will only be this box.    If you want the snap target to be two neighboring boxes, hover a bit higher above the middle of the combined width of these boxes.    And if you would like to snap to the full width of the row, hover some distance above the middle box.    Click once to insert the new text box and it snaps together with all three text boxes below.    As you can see, it’s easy to form a table by snapping think-cell’s text boxes together. Unlike with Power Point shapes, the structure of this table is preserved while you add content or change other elements on the slide.15.1.2 Snapping text boxes at a distance It is also possible to only snap the outer edges of an inserted text box to existing boxes on the slide. This will place the new box separately from the others but still maintain the same width for both:  Click the     \\xa0Text Box button and hover below the left edge of the element until you see a thin grey line emerge as a snap indicator.    Click and hold down the mouse button as the left edge snaps.  Move your mouse below the right edge of the table until you see a similar line there to which the insertion frame snaps.    Release the mouse button.  The outer edges of the new text box are now snapped to the object above. If the width of any of the two changes, the other will be resized accordingly. Note: These dynamic snap connections are indicated by a gray line when creating them. When dragging the edge of a text box to align with a shape that is not dynamically placed by think-cell, such as a chart or a native Power Point shape, a red line will be displayed. This indicates that the dragged edge of the text box will merely be fixed to the position aligning with the corresponding edge of the other shape (for more detail on fixing the position of an edge see 15.8.2 Locking elements to a position). This means that it will remain in this position even when the other shape is moved or resized. 15.1.3 Snapping text boxes across slides You can even snap text boxes together across slides:  Place a text box (A) on one slide.  Place a text box (B) on another slide.    Click and hold the left handle of the text box (B). While holding the mouse button, scroll with the mouse wheel or press Page Up or Page Down until you see the slide with text box (A). The outline of text box (B) will be shown in gray.  Drag the handle to align with the left edge of text box (A). A thin gray line will be shown as a snap indicator. Release the mouse button.    You will be back on the original slide with text box (B), with its left edge now aligning with the left edge of text box (A) on the other slide.    Repeat the process for the right edge.  Now, as with the example where both text boxes were on the same slide, if the position or width of one of the text boxes changes, the other will change along with it so that they stay horizontally aligned, even though they are on different slides. This makes it easy to create slide layouts that stay consistent across slides without manual adjustment.15.2 Duplicating text boxes After learning how to insert and snap think-cell’s text boxes, let’s have a look at how to duplicate them. There are different ways to do this, most of which resemble the options you are familiar with from working with Power Point shapes:  You can duplicate think-cell’s text boxes by selecting them and hitting Ctrl+D. The familiar orange insertion frame appears for the duplicated boxes and can be moved to your preferred snap position. Click once to insert it there.  You can use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to insert a copy of the selected text boxes.  Another option known from Power Point is to right-click and drag the frame of selected text boxes. Release to drop the duplicate into position.  The same duplication can be achieved when holding down Ctrl while dragging with the left mouse button.  Finally, another quick and easy way to insert a snapped copy of existing rows or columns of text boxes is to click the small    Duplicate buttons that appears when text boxes are selected.    15.3 Deleting text boxes If you would like to delete individual text boxes or entire rows or columns, just select or multi-select them (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects) and hit the Del key. You can also right-click into the selection and click the red     \\xa0Delete button in think-cell’s context menu.15.4 Moving text boxes Now, let’s look at how you can move an existing text box (or a selection of text boxes) to another position. To do this:  Left-click on its frame to select it and begin the drag. It is important to click on the frame instead of inside the text box, as that would select the text box content for text editing.    Click and drag the text box to the new position. You will see different snap targets while you move your mouse.    When you are happy with the position, release the mouse button to drop and snap the text box there.  You may also use Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V to move a text box from one position to another. Reordering columns in a table is an example for moving multiple text boxes. You simply select all text boxes in the column and then drag them to the new position or press Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V and then choose the new position.15.5 Unsnapping text boxes or changing snap connections After learning how to snap text boxes together in different ways, let’s look at how to unsnap them or change the snap connections. Both can be done easily. To unsnap a text box:  Click to select it.  Click on one of the handles.    Drag away from the other element the box is snapped to and release.    Repeat this for other edges if necessary.  You can also change the snap connection by dragging handles to a new snap target. The gray snap indicator lines help you snap the text box to another position of your choice.    Just release the mouse button once you are happy with the snap position.15.6 Setting the same size for multiple text boxes You can select multiple elements and choose     \\xa0Same Height or     \\xa0 Same Width  from the context menu of an element included in the selection.    The elements are resized to make them the same width.    To return to individual sizes for the text boxes, select one of the text boxes, click on the double-ended arrow and press Del or Backspace.15.7 Building a complex example The sections above described all the basic interactions with think-cell’s text-boxes. As an example, let’s make use of them to build a complete slide with text boxes from scratch that will look like this:    Start by inserting your first text box from the ribbon button     \\xa0Text Box.    Enter the text and choose an appropriate fill color, if desired. In the following, simply entering text or making formatting changes is not explicitly mentioned between steps anymore.  Use Ctrl-Drag to duplicate the box until you have your desired number of boxes.    Insert a new text box above as a heading and snap it to the full width of the five boxes below.   Add boxes below the five text boxes with the help of the    Duplicate Below button. You can add a bulleted list to the text boxes using Power Point’s buttons in the Home tab, when the text inside the box is selected.     Insert a separate box below and snap it only to the outer edges of the table above as a sub-heading.    Now duplicate this box by hitting Ctrl+D and snap it below.    Use the alignment control in the floating toolbar to center your text in selected boxes.    Right-click and drag the topmost box to copy it to the very bottom. As you can see, all the positioning of the text boxes is done automatically by think-cell. Not a single box has been moved manually.    Unsnap some of the text boxes from each other to create a gap between them.    Finally, multi-select the text boxes with the column headings, right-click into the selection and choose     \\xa0Same Width from the context menu. This gives all five columns the same width.   15.8 Setting a fixed size or locked position of elements After building up your slide from elements and content, you may wish to manually adjust little layout details and fix the final position and dimensions of the elements on your slide. Let’s work again with the example above. The elements fill the whole slide and are centered on it.    As there is some space between the text boxes, you may want to tighten the structure a bit by fixing its size, or you may want to explicitly leave larger margins by fixing the position.15.8.1 Setting a fixed size In Power Point you can resize a shape by holding down the Ctrl key and dragging its boundary. You can do the same in think-cell:  Select all elements with your mouse.  Hold down Ctrl, click on the handle in one of the corners, hold down the mouse button and drag it to constrain the size of your text box structure.    Release the mouse button.    There is less space between the text boxes now, while the whole structure is still centered on the slide. Instead of choosing the size with Ctrl-dragging, you can also enter the size directly:  Select the element or elements that you wish to resize    Hold down Ctrl and drag one of the handles on the blue boundary to set a fixed size.    Click on the double-ended arrow representing the fixed size    Enter the desired size into the control.    As units, you can use points, length units like millimeters or inches, and fractions of the slide height or slide width.    We recommend that you do not set a fixed size until you have added all content to the slide. To reestablish automatic sizing based on your content, click on the double-ended arrow and press Del or Backspace.15.8.2 Locking elements to a position To leave some margin next to elements, you can lock the text boxes to specific positions:  Select all elements.  Click on the little lock icon in the bottom left corner.    Hold down the mouse button and drag to the position you want the lower edge of the element structure to be.    Release the mouse button to close the lock and fix the elements into position.  Repeat this for the left, right or upper margin if necessary.    To make the most of automatic layout, we recommend that you do not lock your text boxes until you have added all content to the slide. To change the locked position of an edge, simply click and drag the lock icon shown on the red line next to the shape or on the ruler or slide margin. To open a lock and reestablish the automatic positioning of the corresponding edges, simply click once onto the closed lock next to the shape or on the ruler or slide margin. You can also click one of the round handles on the red line. Repeat this for other closed locks as needed.15.8.3 Locking positions by default When the    Lock Positions by Default option is enabled in the    Tools menu, all think-cell layout elements will be inserted with closed locks on all edges that are not snapped to another edge. For an element inserted without any snapped edges, this means that both its size and position are completely fixed, and will not be adjusted automatically. They will stay exactly in the position shown in the insertion preview, as indicated by the red lines.    With    Lock Positions by Default enabled, releasing a dragged handle in a location where it does not create a snap connection will also fix the position of the corresponding edges in that position. This also goes for moving all edges simultaneously by clicking and dragging the whole element: The corresponding edges will keep their relative distances and will be locked into place exactly where you release them, except for those which end up snapped to another edge. This means that you can resize and move think-cell elements much like native Power Point shapes, while still being able to define edges that ought to dynamically move together by snapping them to each other. When    Lock Positions by Default is enabled, you can use the right mouse button to the same effect that the left mouse button would have when the option is disabled. For example, you can right-click when inserting an element to insert it without any locks closed so that it is placed and sized automatically.  Conversely, when the option is disabled, you can use the right mouse button to the same effect that the left mouse button would have when the option is enabled. For example, you can drag a handle with the right mouse button to fix the corresponding edge to the position you dragged it to.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. 5. Data entry        Resources     Manual    Data entry  Contents5.1 Internal datasheet Every chart created with think-cell has an associated datasheet. The datasheet is opened by double-clicking the chart or by clicking the     \\xa0Open Datasheet button that appears when the chart is selected. The datasheet also opens immediately when a new chart is inserted. think-cell uses a customized Microsoft Excel sheet for data input, which you can use in the same way as regular Excel. You can use all the same shortcut keys, you can enter formulas instead of numbers, and so forth. But of course you can also use an Excel file as a data source (see 22. Excel data links). To insert or delete a row (or column) you can use the respective buttons in the toolbar of the datasheet. The standard buttons for undo and redo and cut, copy and paste are available as well. Note: If you have Microsoft’s Chinese Conversion feature installed, you will find the options Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese in the datasheet’s toolbar.5.2 Absolute and relative values The think-cell datasheet alternatively supports entry of absolute or relative values. The distinction between the two types of data is made by the Excel cell formatting. You can always toggle the interpretation of a column’s data with the     button. Keep in mind that for the display in the chart, it does not matter if you enter percentages or absolute values. If you enter absolute values but want to label the chart with percentages (or vice versa), think-cell performs the necessary conversion (see 6.5.5 Label content). A simple datasheet with only absolute values looks like this:    For simple charts based on absolute values only, the 100%= row on top of the chart data can be left empty. If you choose to label the chart with percentages, the percentages are calculated from the absolute values, assuming the sum of each column to be 100%. You can enter explicit values in the 100%= row to override this assumption. The following datasheet calculates percentages based on 100% being equal to a value of 50:    Alternatively, you can fill in the datasheet with percentages. Again, you can choose to label the chart with absolute or relative values. In order to have think-cell calculate absolute values from the percentages you entered, you should fill in the absolute values that represent 100% in the 100%= row. The following datasheet uses percentages to specify the same data values:    The default behavior of the datasheet depends on the chart type: 100%-charts and area or Mekko charts with %-axis as well as pie charts default to percentages, while all other charts default to absolute values.5.3 Transposing the datasheet The layout of a think-cell datasheet depends on the chart type. In bar charts, for example, columns contain the data for a single series, while in column charts, rows contain the data for a single series. Here is a typical datasheet for a column chart:    If you would instead like to work with a datasheet where columns contain the data for a single series, with rows representing categories, you can simply click the     \\xa0Transpose Sheet button to transpose the datasheet, swapping the row and column data together with any category/series interpretation. Here is the transposed version of the previous column chart datasheet:    Note that the columns have also been flipped to preserve the relationship between the visual order of data in the datasheet and the order of the data in the chart.5.4 Reverse order in datasheet In think-cell, the visual order of data in the datasheet always corresponds to the order of the data in the chart. This is also true for flipped charts (see 3.5.2 Rotate and flip elements). If you want to flip the data in the datasheet, you can use the     \\xa0Flip Rows (or     \\xa0Flip Columns) button in the datasheet’s toolbar.   5.5 Edit data layout You can decide whether to include any of the special rows and columns in the datasheet, such as the Series label column, the 100%= row, or the Category label row. To do so, click     \\xa0Edit Data Layout in the datasheet\\'s toolbar, and add or remove them via the menu that appears on top or to left of the special columns and rows, respectively.    Note: The top-left-most cell that is not a special cell is always interpreted as the first data cell. This means for example that when the 100%= row has been disabled in a non-transposed datasheet, where rows represent series, the data for the first series would start in cell B2, and its series label would be in cell A2. Special rows and columns that have been removed from the datasheet are effectively treated as empty; for example, in a datasheet without a 100%= row, the sum of the absolute values will be used as the reference for calculating percentages displayed in the chart as explained in 5.2 Absolute and relative values.5.6 Chart scanner     Scan an image of a bar or column chart on your screen and use the scanned data in a think-cell chart or an Excel sheet. You can scan images from any source on your screen, such as websites, PDF documents, or applications.5.6.1 Use the chart scanner in Power Point To scan an image and use the scanned data in a think-cell chart, follow these steps: In Power Point, create any chart except a scatter chart, a bubble chart, a Mekko chart with unit axis, and a Gantt chart. Open the chart’s datasheet: double-click the chart, or select the chart and select Open Datasheet    .                                      In the datasheet\\'s toolbar, select Extract and Paste Numerical Data    .                                      Move and resize the chart scanner window so that the capture area contains the image you want to scan. Include only the chart area, axes, and labels. Keep headers, references, and explanations outside the capture window. Wait for the chart scanner window to finish scanning. When the chart scanner finishes scanning, it outlines the chart segments in red and the chart baseline in green, and enables the Fill Datasheet button.  To rescan the image, move or resize the chart scanner. If the chart scanner can\\'t scan your image accurately, inform think-cell support by selecting Report Bad Scan. To insert the scanned data into your datasheet, select Fill Datasheet. The chart updates to reflect the new data. Close the chart scanner. Source: Giattino et al. 2024. \"Annual global corporate investment in artificial intelligence, by type.\"\\xa0Our World in Data.You can format and edit the updated chart just like any other think-cell chart.5.6.2 Use the chart scanner in Excel To scan an image and use the scanned data in an Excel sheet, follow these steps: In Excel, select the cell range where you want to insert the scanned data.  Select think-cell > Data > Chart Scanner    or Insert > think-cell > Chart Scanner   . Move and resize the chart scanner window so that the capture area contains the image you want to scan. Include only the chart area, axes, and labels. Keep headers, references, and explanations outside the capture window. Wait for the chart scanner to finish scanning. When the chart scanner finishes scanning, it outlines the chart segments in red and the chart baseline in green, and enables the Paste Into Excel button. To rescan the image, move or resize the chart scanner window. If the chart scanner can\\'t scan your image accurately, inform think-cell support by selecting Report Bad Scan. To insert the scanned data into your Excel sheet, select Paste Into Excel. The Excel sheet updates to reflect the new data. Close the chart scanner. You can analyze the data in Excel or link it to a think-cell element in Power Point. To learn more, see 22. Excel data links.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. 19. Agendas        Resources     Manual    Agendas   Using the agenda element you can manage the agenda of your presentation, create a table of contents and add or rearrange individual chapters. All agenda slides are automatically kept in sync as you edit the presentation.Contents19.1 Inserting a chapter To start a new chapter of your presentation, choose     \\xa0Chapter from the Elements menu. A new slide is inserted after the current slide which contains a new line “Chapter”. The new line is selected, so you can immediately type the name of the new chapter, overwriting the placeholder text. The new slide is by default titled “Agenda” which can be changed if desired (see 19.9 Role model). When editing the agenda, you can also select a chapter heading and press Ctrl+Alt+↓. This will insert a new chapter after the one currently selected.19.2 Reordering chapters While editing an agenda slide you can change the order of chapters using the following methods:  select a chapter heading, then hold Shift+Alt and use ↑ ↓ to move the current chapter up or down,  drag the chapter heading to a new location using the mouse or drag while holding Ctrl to duplicate the chapter.  If you move a chapter, slides belonging to that chapter are moved along, i.e., all slides between the agenda slide of the moved chapter and the agenda slide of the following chapter. In the slide sorter view you can reorder agenda slides or copy, paste and duplicate them in the same manner as normal slides. If you change the order of chapters, all agenda slides are updated accordingly.19.3 Placing the agenda The agenda element is centered on the slide if you do not change the placement. To move it, you can lock the top, bottom, left or right edge to a specific position. For example, if a logo or image is displayed on the left side of every agenda slide, you can lock the left edge to leave enough space between logo and agenda and the agenda element will grow to the right to accommodate longer chapter headings. You should choose the correct agenda placement after inserting the first chapter slide, as subsequent chapter slides will then use the same placement automatically. First, you need to select the whole agenda element. Position the mouse pointer so that all chapter headings are surrounded by an orange boundary and click once. Alternatively, use Power Point’s lasso selection to include all chapter headings. Afterwards, the whole agenda is highlighted with a blue boundary and every edge shows three handles: at both ends and in the center. With the agenda element handles showing, you place the agenda by dragging one of the handles to the desired position along one of Power Point’s rulers. Drag one of the handles and a drag target     appears at a position along, but slightly to the right of the left ruler or slightly below the top ruler. When you move the mouse to this position a red helper line and a lock icon will appear while dragging along the ruler. Once you release the mouse button, the edge is locked at that position.    The size of the agenda element is always determined dynamically, depending on the length and number of chapter headings. Therefore, you should lock two edges of the agenda element at most, so that in can grow and shrink by placing the other edges dynamically. To change the position of a locked edge, drag the lock icon to another position. To unlock an edge and let think-cell place the agenda automatically again, simply drag the lock icon away from the ruler. By default, the left and right edges of all agenda elements are snapped together across slides, as explained in 15.1.3 Snapping text boxes across slides. This means that when you fix the position of the edge of one of them, the corresponding edge of all other agenda elements is also moved and fixed to that position on their respective slides. You can add or remove snap connections by dragging the handles that are shown when selecting the whole agenda element (see also 15.5 Unsnapping text boxes or changing snap connections). For example, if you would like the top edge of all agenda elements to always be in the same position on all agenda slides:  Insert the first agenda slide by selecting    Chapter from the Elements menu.  Insert a second agenda slide, for example by selecting the chapter heading and pressing Ctrl+Alt+↓.  Select the whole agenda element by clicking on its boundary, when an orange selection frame is shown around all chapter headings.    Click and hold the handle on the top edge.  While holding the mouse button, switch to the other agenda slide by scrolling with the mouse wheel, or using Page Up or Page Down.  Drag the top edge of the gray selection outline that is shown to align with the top edge of the agenda element on that slide. A thin gray line will be shown as a snap indicator.    Release the mouse button.  Now the top edges of the two agenda elements are also snapped together, so that their position on the slide will always be the same. When you add additional agenda slides, the top edges of the agenda elements on these slides will inherit this snap connection as explained in 19.9 Role model.19.4 Multi-level hierarchy of chapters The chapter hierarchy is determined by text levels. Power Point provides several ways to change these. You can use Power Point’s buttons for increasing and decreasing the list level. Alternatively, hold down Shift+Alt and use the arrow keys ← and →. Lower-level chapters will only be shown on chapter slides of the same level and on the slide of the parent chapter. If a chapter with hidden sub-chapters is selected, a marker     is shown below the beginning of the heading text. Clicking this double arrow takes you to the first chapter slide that shows the hidden sub-chapters. Agenda slides will be hidden during the slide show if there are no slides between a chapter and its first sub-chapter, i.e., the main chapter does not have content of its own. This avoids having to fast-forward chapter slides until you reach the actual content during slide shows. It is achieved by automatically setting Power Point’s “Hide Slide” attribute. For example, when a chapter “A” contains a sub-chapter “A1”, and there are no content slides between the agenda slides for “A” and “A1”, then the agenda slide for “A” is automatically set to “hidden” in Power Point. Similarly, when the condition no longer holds, the slide is automatically “unhidden” in Power Point. During slide shows, a displayed slide number will jump whenever a hidden agenda slide is omitted. To prevent this and remove all such slides from the presentation, select the entire group of chapter headings and right-click to bring up the context menu, then select     Remove Hidden Agenda Slides. To add content between a removed chapter slide and the first sub-chapter slide, select     \\xa0Insert Hidden Agenda Slides and navigate to the desired location in the presentation.19.5 Multiple agendas in a single presentation It is possible to split the presentation into multiple sections, each with its own agenda. To do this, go to the first slide of the second section and choose     \\xa0Split Agenda from the Elements menu. You can identify a splitter slide by the marker at the top of the slide. Chapters after a splitter are not included in agenda slides before the splitter and vice versa. The different sections in the presentation have independent agendas. Typically, a splitter is used to separate a backup section from the main part of the presentation. In this case, usually the backup section has its own title slide, which just says “Backup” (with no agenda or overview on it). This is where the agenda splitter should be placed. The chapters after this slide do not appear on agenda slides at the beginning of the presentation and the backup slides are not moved along when moving the last chapter of the main part of the presentation. Note: If you place the agenda splitter on the first agenda slide in the backup, the splitter would be moved along if you move this chapter later and would also be duplicated if you duplicate the agenda slide.19.6 Inserting a table of contents To add a slide showing all top-level chapters without any highlighting, choose     \\xa0Table of Contents from the Elements menu. If you have not yet defined any chapters, the slide will be empty, and will be populated when you add chapters. An example is shown below:    If the presentation already contains chapter slides, the contents slide will be inserted before the first chapter slide. If there are no chapter slides yet, an empty contents slide will be inserted after the current slide. Simply use Power Point’s slide sorter view to move it to the desired position.19.7 Styling the agenda When a chapter heading is selected, the floating toolbar offers controls for changing the font size and style (see 6.5.1 Font), the fill (see 3.4.1 Color and fill) and the style of the outline (see 3.4.6 Line style). When an outline is used, you can also change its color. The styling of a chapter heading is used for all chapters of the same type. For example, if you assign a blue fill and dashed outline to a highlighted top-level chapter heading, all other highlighted top-level chapters will be styled in the same way.    When styling the agenda, think-cell differentiates between the following types:  chapter is current and at top level  chapter is top-level and contains the current chapter  chapter is top-level but does not contain current chapter  chapter is current but not at top level  chapter is an immediate child of current chapter, and current chapter is top-level  neither chapter nor current chapter are top-level, and chapter is not on the path from the top-level chapter to the current chapter, but either one of its siblings is on this path or it is an immediate child of the current chapter (chapter is “in subtree of current”)  chapter is not top-level and not current and not “in subtree of current”, but the top-level chapter of this chapter is current  chapter is not top-level and not current and not “in subtree of current”, but this chapter is below the same top-level as the current chapter  any other chapter (except table of contents)  chapter is in table of contents, and chapter is top-level  chapter is in table of contents, and chapter is not top-level  neither chapter nor current chapter are top-level, and chapter is on the path from the top-level chapter to the current chapter   Using the floating toolbar you can also choose between predefined styles. Usually, only top-level headings are shown in the table of contents. The styles suffixed with (expanded) show all chapter headings. You can change the properties of all chapters on any agenda slide. You do not need to switch to the specific chapter’s slide.19.8 Tips and tricks You can use all four arrow keys for chapter shortcuts: Shift+Alt and ↑ ↓ for reordering chapters and Shift+Alt and ← → for changing the hierarchy level. In slide view, double-clicking the orange selection frame around a chapter heading takes you to the associated agenda slide. A single click accomplishes the same during a slide show. Selecting a chapter heading and changing the font size and style using the floating toolbar applies the same change to all other chapters of the same type. However, selecting part of the chapter heading text and using Power Point’s controls, e.g. for italicizing a proper name, will change this chapter’s text on all agenda slides but will not affect other chapters.19.9 Role model After you insert the first agenda slide, the next slides you insert will copy the closest existing agenda slide, including shapes on the slide and which slide master and layout it uses. Thus, if you've applied a specific slide master or layout to an agenda slide, these settings are inherited by all agenda slides that you create afterwards.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2.

Exchanging files with Power Point        Resources     Manual    Exchanging files with Power Point   This chapter covers some issues that arise when your coworkers use Power Point without think-cell installed.Contents B.1 Loading files from think-cell in Power Point Any files created by Power Point with think-cell installed are 100% compatible with Power Point. This means that coworkers and customers who do not have think-cell installed can open and edit the files without noticing any difference. The think-cell elements appear as regular Power Point shapes such as textboxes and Power Point chart objects.B.2 Reimporting think-cell elements from Power Point Consider the following scenario:  A presentation has been created using Power Point with think-cell installed, and contains think-cell elements.  The same presentation has been edited in Power Point without think-cell, and some of the shapes that are part of a think-cell element have been altered.  Now, you want to use think-cell again to further modify the elements.  In this scenario, when you attempt to select a think-cell element that has been altered without think-cell, the software will recognize the element as inconsistent and display the following message box:    In order to proceed, you will need to decide whether to continue using the Power Point edited version without think-cell functionality or to reimport the element to think-cell. You should carefully consider the following consequences before making your decision:  Manually carry over changes to think-cell reimports the element to think-cell and restores the intelligent think-cell element functionality, but discards all changes made without think-cell. If you wish to preserve any of the changes then they must be manually re-applied to the think-cell element.  Continue editing without think-cell functionality continues to use the Power Point edited version and ensures that all changes are preserved. The intelligent think-cell element functionality, however, is lost and standard Power Point tools must be used to further edit these shapes and objects.  If you decide to use Manually carry over changes to think-cell, then the following toolbar is displayed, letting you compare slides containing the alternative versions of the think-cell element:    The toolbar lets you quickly and easily view the slides containing the Power Point and think-cell versions of the element. You may want to compare the think-cell element with the Power Point version and compare and copy, for example, data values to reflect any changes that you wish to preserve in the think-cell version. Having made any necessary changes, click the Finish button to remove the Power Point version from the presentation and end the reimport process.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2.

Introduction to automation        Resources     Manual    Introduction to automation   think-cell helps you to quickly create professional, data-driven charts in Power Point. But what about automating periodic reports, or using a web service to create charts based on your parameters, or exporting your business intelligence reports as Power Point slides? Using think-cell’s automation, you can do this quickly with your Excel or JSON data, and without the mistakes commonly found in a manual process. All you need is:  A Power Point presentation with think-cell charts.  Programmatic logic to control the automation.  Let’s begin by creating a Power Point presentation with a think-cell chart and a text box for the slide title as an automation template:  Create a chart in Power Point as described in 4. Introduction to charting and later chapters. Any think-cell chart type will work, including all decorations like axes and difference arrows.    The initial data is not important as it will later be replaced programmatically by the real data.  In the contextual toolbar of the chart, click on the field that says Update Chart Name.  Enter a unique name, e.g., Chart1, which you will refer to later.    Where the slide title should appear on the slide, insert a    Named Text Field from the Elements menu.  In the contextual toolbar of the text field, click on the field that says Update Chart Name.  Enter a unique name, e.g., Title, which you will refer to later.    Save the presentation, e.g., as template.pptx.  The next step is to create programmatic logic which will merge your Excel or JSON data with the template slide.  For Excel data, refer to 26. Automation with Excel data.  For JSON data, refer to 27. Automation with JSON data.  With the process above you can create presentations with arbitrary combinations of think-cell charts. You can prepare a library of all the chart types you need and, as required, versions with different chart decorations enabled. Then, you can freely combine these templates and supply them with data for use in a new presentation using either Excel or JSON. Note: This approach replaces the need for a general API to create charts and add chart decorations, which is not supported.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. 4. Introduction to charting        Resources     Manual    Introduction to charting   In this chapter, a step-by-step tutorial will show you how to create a chart from a scribble like this:    A more elaborate presentation of the basic concepts of think-cell and details on the various chart types can be found in 3. Basic concepts and in the following chapters.Contents4.1 Inserting a new chart With think-cell installed, you will find the following group in the Insert tab of Power Point’s ribbon.    Inserting a chart into your presentation is very similar to inserting a Power Point shape. Go to the think-cell group and click the Elements button. Then, select the required chart type. In our example, we want to insert a column chart, which is represented by this button:     Once you have chosen a chart type, a rectangle will appear with the mouse pointer, indicating where the chart will be inserted on the slide. When you are inserting or resizing a chart, you will notice that it snaps to certain locations, aligning with existing objects on the slide.    The chart is automatically selected after insertion, as indicated by a blue highlighted outline. If a chart you want to modify is not selected, you can select it by clicking on it.4.2 Adding and removing labels After inserting a new column chart, both category labels and series labels are shown automatically. There are several ways to remove and add labels. The easiest way to remove a single label is to select it and press the Del key. The easiest way to remove all labels of a particular type is to select the respective button from the chart’s context menu. To remove the series label like in our example column chart, click     \\xa0 Remove Series Label  in the chart’s context menu. To access the context menu of a chart, move the mouse to a point within the chart’s rectangle where there are no other objects and click the right mouse button. Read more about editing text labels in the chapter 6. Text labels.   4.3 Entering chart data When you select the column chart, a datasheet button     \\xa0Open Datasheet is displayed in the bottom right corner of the chart. Click the datasheet button, or simply double-click the chart, to open the datasheet. The datasheet opens automatically after insertion of a new chart. Now, enter the data from our example column chart into the datasheet. Type in only the actual numbers. Do not round numbers or calculate totals—think-cell will do this for you. For most chart types, you can simply input the numbers the way you see them in the scribble, from left to right and from top to bottom. The tab key Tab can be used, just as in Microsoft Excel, to conveniently move to the next column in a row, and the enter key Enter can be used to jump to the first column of the next row. The datasheet for our example column chart looks like this:    Note that the chart on the slide instantly updates to reflect the changes in the datasheet. It even grows and shrinks depending on the area of the datasheet that you use. Years are automatically inserted as category labels in the first row of the datasheet. The sequence of years is automatically continued when you start entering data in the following column. Having entered the data, our example chart looks like this:    As you can see, think-cell has already performed a good deal of work to make the chart look “right.” In particular, it automatically placed all labels and added column totals. The next section explains the last few steps to finish our example chart.4.4 Styling the chart Every chart element consists of a number of features. In our example, text labels and column segments are the most important features of the column chart. Each kind of feature has a number of specific properties that you can change in order to give it a different look. To change a feature’s properties, you have to select it first. You can also select multiple features at a time to change their properties together. Selecting features is very similar to selecting files in the Windows Explorer:  Select a single feature by clicking on it with the left mouse button.  Or select multiple features by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking.  You can also select a contiguous range of features by holding down the Shift key, moving the mouse pointer and then clicking with the mouse. Watch how the affected features highlight while you move the mouse with the Shift key held down.  The following screenshot shows how all column segments of the second data series highlight in orange while they are collectively selected in a Shift-click operation:    When you select features, a floating toolbar containing the corresponding property controls will appear. For the selection of column segments as illustrated above, for example, the Fill Color control becomes available in the toolbar:    In our example, we want to change the shading of the second data series, as required by the scribble. Therefore, after selecting the column segments of the series, we choose Accent\\xa06 shading:    Note that the labels automatically turn white to make them easier to read on the dark background. Finally, the numbers in our example chart are still displayed with incorrect precision. According to the scribble, they should be rendered with one decimal place precision. We simply have to select one of the segment labels, and the floating toolbar changes to include the Number Format control:    By typing the decimal place into the number format box, you can specify the desired display format and it will be applied to all numbers of the same type in the chart. Alternatively you can click on the arrow and select the desired format from the drop down box. Note that the actual numbers you type or select do not matter, they only act as an example of the required formatting (read more in section 6.5.3 Number format).    The scribble is now represented by a clear, professional looking chart. As you become familiar with using think-cell, you will be able to create a chart like this in less than one minute.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. 24. Tableau data        Resources     Manual    Tableau data   When the source data for your data-driven elements is available in Tableau, you can create charts and tables directly from there. When data in Tableau changes, you can update the linked elements with a single click to reflect that change.Contents24.1 Requirements for linking to Tableau Naturally, you need access to a Tableau server to link a chart to Tableau data. think-cell supports both on-premise and cloud hosted versions of Tableau. To link to filtered versions of a view, you need to be able to create and save custom views on the server on which the view is hosted. think-cell uses an interface to Tableau that is available in a browser window to extract the data represented in a Tableau view and makes the data available to a think-cell element in place of its datasheet. This part of think-cell's functionality is implemented as a browser extension, so you also need a supported browser and the think-cell extension must be installed. Currently, the extension is available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. It is installed automatically along with think-cell into Chrome and Edge, and can be installed manually into Firefox (see 2.2.4 Installing the browser extension). think-cell can only import Tableau data from views displayed in a browser, not directly from Tableau Desktop.24.2 Creating a chart from Tableau data  Open a Tableau dashboard in your supported browser.  Click the icon of the think-cell extension:    The different views on your dashboard are detected and shaded in green when the mouse pointer is over them. Click one.    A new tab is opened with the view's data. Pick the element type you want to create.    Assign columns to the parts of the think-cell datasheet pertinent to the chosen element type, i.e., for a stacked chart, categories, series and values.     Click Create to create a think-cell chart in Power Point.    think-cell remembers the connection to the Tableau data! Clicking on the datasheet button of the element in Power Point will open the tab with the view's data in your default browser. There, you can click on Update to transmit updated data to Power Point. You can also start the data update from think-cell's 22.6 Data Links dialog or the element's floating toolbar:   Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. 2. Installation and update        Resources     Manual    Installation and update   This chapter guides you through the installation of your personal copy of think-cell. If you are about to prepare the deployment of think-cell in a larger organization, you should skip this chapter and read the A. Deployment guide.2.1 System requirements On Windows, think-cell works with Microsoft Office 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019 or 2021 for Windows, with at least Power Point and Excel installed. think-cell also works with the fully installed versions and Click-to-Run versions of the desktop Office apps in Office 365. On Mac, think-cell works with Microsoft Office 2016 (version 16.9 or later), 2019 or 2021 for Mac and mac OS High Sierra (10.13) or later. think-cell also works with the fully installed versions of the desktop Office apps in Office 365. The installation of think-cell requires less than 200\\xa0MB of disk space.2.2 First installation2.2.1 Installing think-cell Please close all instances of Microsoft Power Point and Microsoft Excel before installing think-cell. The installation can be started directly from the online source. When you download the setup file you may choose the following:  Open in order to install the software directly from the internet.  Save to Disk and start the installation by double-clicking the downloaded setup file.  On Windows, the installation wizard asks for the installation path, then copies the required files and updates the registry. If the installation wizard detects that you do not have sufficient privileges for a regular installation, a single-user installation will be performed. This means that think-cell can only be used with your current Windows login name. think-cell uses the same language as in the menus and dialogs of your installation of Microsoft Office, provided that it is supported by think-cell (see A.1.2 Language for more details). If it is not yet supported, English is used.2.2.2 mac OS: Grant permissions to think-cell during installation and first start In mac OS Sequoia 15, Apple has implemented stricter security measures to better protect users. As part of the new security framework, think-cell requires data access permissions during installation on mac OS 15 and later.Furthermore, on all mac OS versions, think-cell requires file access permissions when you first start Power Point and Excel. When prompted, grant permission by selecting Allow, otherwise, think-cell won\\'t run.2.2.3 Entering the license key The public version of think-cell requires a valid license key, which expires after a fixed period of time. When you start Power Point with a think-cell trial version for the first time, or when your license key has expired, you need to enter a valid license key.    Please visit our website or contact our sales team to order such a license key for the first time or as a renewal of your existing deployment. In any case, you can always click the Cancel button and continue using Power Point without think-cell. To enter the license key later, click the     \\xa0Activate think-cell button in the think-cell ribbon group. The setting  Automatically report any think-cell error and check if there is already an update for it  controls error reporting (see 2.5 Error reporting). We recommend to enable it to help us improve the software. No user data is included in the error report.2.2.4 Installing the browser extension think-cell comes with a browser extension to enable its 24. Tableau data functionality, and to import 18. Images and icons from the web into Power Point. The extension is available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. The extension is automatically installed into Chrome and Edge when think-cell is installed. For security reasons, extensions installed in this way need to be enabled manually. When first starting Chrome after installing think-cell:  Click Error ⋮ to open the menu, if it is not open already.  Click New extension added (think-cell).   Click Enable extension to complete the installation of the extension.  When first starting Edge after installing think-cell:  Click Turn on extension to complete the installation of the extension.    Note: When you choose to remove the extension, and decide later on that you want to use it after all, you will need to manually install it from the Chrome Web Store or from Edge Add-ons. This is true even if you (un- and then) reinstall think-cell. For Firefox, you need to manually install the think-cell extension:  Open the think-cell extension page in Firefox. Alternatively, you can go to ≡, then select Add-ons and themes, then search for \"think-cell\" and navigate the result list.  On the think-cell extension page, click Add to Firefox  In the dialog asking for permissions, answer Add.  In the confirmation dialog, click Okay to complete the installation of the extension. 2.3 Automatic update think-cell regularly checks online to see if a new release is available, and if so, attempts to download and install the updated installation file. The automatic download is subject to the following conditions:  The check for a new release is performed once when Power Point or Excel is started with think-cell installed and enabled.  The automatic download runs quietly in the background and only occupies unused bandwidth. If the internet connection is interrupted or there is other network traffic, the download is paused until the network is again available.  All files that are executed and installed by the automatic update are digitally signed by think-cell.2.4 Troubleshooting For latest information on known issues and workarounds please refer to our website at: https://www.think-cell.com/kb If you cannot find a solution in the knowledge base or this manual, feel free to contact our support team. Open the    Tools menu in the think-cell ribbon group and click on Request Support... Choose from the opening window whether you would like to attach certain slides to an email to think-cell’s support team. This often helps us to address your problem. After confirming with OK your email application will open an email that is ready to be sent.2.5 Error reporting At think-cell we are committed to stability and robustness as key factors for the professional use of our software. When an error condition arises while you are using think-cell, the software automatically generates a report that helps us to understand the problem and fix it in the next release. The error report only contains information about the internal state of our software. No user data is included in the error report. The software sends the error report encrypted. You might notice a short delay while an error report is being sent, but in most cases you can continue using think-cell as usual. If an update that addresses the error you encountered is already available, it will be installed automatically. For more information on think-cell’s automated error reporting refer to section A.3.5 Error reporting.2.6 Temporarily deactivating think-cell To quickly work around compatibility problems, or other issues arising from the use of think-cell, you have the option to temporarily deactivate think-cell without uninstalling the software.    In the    Tools menu in the think-cell ribbon group in Power Point, there is an option called Deactivate think-cell. When you select this option, think-cell will be deactivated immediately. With think-cell deactivated, charts are presented as regular Power Point shapes. To re-enable think-cell, click the     \\xa0Activate think-cell button in the think-cell ribbon group in Power Point. There is no need to close the Power Point application in order to switch between think-cell and plain Power Point. Before you alter think-cell elements without think-cell, be aware of potential compatibility issues (refer to B. Exchanging files with Power Point). Note: You do not need to deactivate think-cell in order to make your presentations accessible to coworkers or clients who may not have think-cell installed. Simply send them the same file you are working with—if think-cell is not installed, they will find a presentation with regular Power Point shapes.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2.

Basic concepts        Resources     Manual    Basic concepts  This chapter presents the basic concepts that apply to working with think-cell elements.3.1 The think-cell ribbon in Power Point After installing think-cell, you can use think-cell commands on the Power Point ribbon.The think-cell ribbon tab contains think-cell and Power Point commands organized from left to right to reflect the process of creating a presentation.If you don't see the think-cell tab, your organization may have its own ribbon configuration and can provide related support. In many cases, you can go to Insert > think-cell to find frequently used think-cell commands. The Design, Review, and Help tabs may also contain think-cell commands.The think-cell tab contains the following groups.Group Description More information Structure Manage presentation agendas19.

Images and icons   Universal connector8.2.7 Universal connectors   Shapes Power Point objects   Images Power Point images Inserting an element into your presentation is very similar to inserting a Power Point object. To create a new element on a slide, select the required element from the Elements menu. To select rotated and flipped versions of these elements, hover over the arrows at the edges of the element button.If you unintentionally select an element, you can do the following: Press Esc to cancel the insert operation. Select a different element. Once you've chosen an element, a rectangle appears on the slide, indicating where the element will be inserted. There are two ways to place the element on the slide: Click once to place the element with the default width and height. Click and drag to create a custom-sized element. Some elements have a fixed width for insertion; in this case, you can only alter the height. You can always change the size of the element later.    When you are inserting or resizing an element, you will notice that it snaps to certain locations.                                       The snapping behavior serves the following purposes:                                  With snapping, objects can be quickly and easily aligned. The highlighting of a border of some other object on the slide indicates that the element you are moving is currently aligned with that object. When resized, some elements snap to an automatically determined and predefined preferred size. In the case of a column chart, for example, its preferred width depends on the number of columns. If you have manually changed the size of an element, you can easily change it back to the default width. It will snap when you come close enough to the default while adjusting the width with the mouse.  As in Power Point, you can hold down the Alt key to move the mouse freely without snapping.3.3 Select objects3.3.1 Select think-cell elements and features think-cell’s elements often contain individually selectable parts that we call features. For example, a chart element consists of the segments corresponding to the values in the datasheet and may also contain labels, axes, difference arrows, connectors and so forth.You can distinguish a feature by the orange frame that appears when the mouse pointer is over it. When you click it, the frame turns blue to mark it as the currently selected feature. Additionally a mini toolbar might appear. It contains a set of property controls you can use to give the feature a different look. It is a good idea to explore a newly-inserted element to get an overview of the features it is made of and their properties. When you right-click on a feature, its context menu appears. You use it to add additional features to the element or remove those currently visible.      Buttons whose functions are unavailable for the current selection are greyed out. The context menu of the entire element is invoked by right-clicking the background of the element. Features always belong to their respective elements and can themselves have further features. As an example, the vertical axis of a line chart is a feature of the chart itself, while the tick marks along the axis are features of the axis. Consequently you use the chart’s context menu to switch on or off the vertical axis and the axis’ context menu to toggle whether tick marks are shown. There are several ways to remove a feature:  Left-click the feature to select it and press the Del or Backspace key on your keyboard.  Right-click the feature to open the think-cell context menu. Click the     \\xa0Delete button to remove the feature from the element.  Open the think-cell context menu that you used to add the feature. Click the same button again to remove it.  Note: You cannot remove data segments from a chart element in this way. All data segments shown are controlled by the internal datasheet. If you delete a cell from the internal datasheet, the corresponding data segment is removed from the chart element. Note: Buttons which toggle the presence of a feature, e.g. if series labels are shown in a chart or not, change their state accordingly. For example, after you have chosen     \\xa0Add Series Label to add series labels to a chart element, the button changes to     \\xa0Remove Series Label. In the following, generally only the state of the button for adding the feature is shown. Detailed information on all the available features is provided in the following chapters accompanying the respective elements they apply to.3.3.2 Select elements with your keyboard If you have already selected an object, you do not need the mouse to select a different object. Instead, you can hold down the Alt key and use the arrow keys ← → ↑ ↓ to select a different object.When a Power Point shape or think-cell element is selected, Alt with arrow keys selects the next shape found in the arrow’s direction.When an element’s feature is selected, Alt with arrow keys selects the next feature of the same type in the element. You can only select a new feature within the same element. To select features of another element, you have to first click on the element.3.3.3 Select multiple objects Within a think-cell element, you can quickly select a range of features of the same type using the Shift or Ctrl keys, similarly to selecting files in Microsoft Windows Explorer. This is called logical multi-selection.Logical multi-selection is particularly useful if you want to colorize an entire data series in a chart element, or if you want to change the formatting of a range of labels. You can even use multi-selection to paste text into multiple labels at once (see 6.6 Pasting text into multiple labels).To select a range of objects with the mouse, click and drag an area selection frame around the objects.To select a range of features within a think-cell element using the keyboard, click on the first feature in the desired range, then hold down Shift and click the last feature in the range. When you move the mouse while holding down Shift, the range of features that is going to be selected is highlighted in orange. You can also use Shift + click to select a range of objects, including a mix of think-cell elements and native Power Point objects.You can use Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ← → ↑ ↓ to extend the current selection to multiple features of the same kind or to multiple objects, including both think-cell elements and native Power Point objects.To add single features to the selection, or to remove single features from the selection, hold down Ctrl while clicking. Again, this is the same way multi-selection works with files in Microsoft Windows Explorer.Pressing Ctrl+A repeatedly will successively increase the size of a selection of features of the same kind. For example, when you select a segment label of a stacked column chart, first all segment labels of the same data series, then all segment labels of all series in the chart, and finally all labels in the chart are selected. Similarly, when a chart segment has been selected, first all segments of the same series, then all segments of the chart, then all segments of all charts on the same slide are selected.3.3.4 Reference object If you select multiple objects on a slide including a think-cell element, you can set any of these objects as the reference object. The reference object has a red dot at its center. Hover over an object until you see the red dot, then click the object to set it as the reference object.You can then align the position of the selected objects in relation to the reference object (see 3.5.1 Align objects), or you can match the width or height of the selected objects to the reference object (see 3.6 Resize objects).You can set the reference object to any Power Point object or think-cell element in a multi-selection by clicking on it. Which object in a multi-selection initially serves as the reference element, as indicated by the red dot, depends on how you add to the selection: Shift+click, Ctrl+Alt+Shift with arrow keys (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects), or Ctrl+A leaves the reference object where it is. A mouse click or Ctrl+click sets the reference object to a new object. If you create a multi-selection by dragging a selection frame over multiple objects or by pressing Ctrl+A without first selecting an object, initially there is no reference element. To align objects to the reference element, make sure that Align Selected Objects is selected in Power Point’s Align menu, then choose the desired alignment option (see 3.5.1 Align objects).To resize objects, right-click on the object you wish to use as the reference element in the multi-selection to open the object’s context menu. Select Same Height or Same Width.3.4 Format and style elements When you select an element or feature by clicking on it a mini toolbar might appear. It contains property controls to change the look of the feature. Only the controls which are applicable to the selected feature are shown in the mini toolbar. In this chapter several general types of controls are described. Through the course of the following chapters, detailed information is provided for all property controls of the mini toolbar in the context of specific element and feature types.3.4.1 Color and fill The color control applies to features that have a fill color, to lines including outlines, arrows and connectors (see 8.2 Arrows and values), and to font color (see also 6.5.2 Font color). For fill colors, the list contains Use Datasheet Fill if you have enabled Use Datasheet Fill on Top in the color scheme control (see 3.4.2 Color scheme). To reset the fill color of a segment you colored manually choose Use Datasheet Fill to use Excel’s cell formatting. If you need other colors than offered by the color control, select the Custom option from the dropdown box. You will then be presented with a color picker where you can choose any color you like; the color you select will immediately be applied to the selected element on the slide, so you can easily judge the result without having to close the dialog.    Hues are arranged horizontally. The vertical position in the top pane represents how muted the color is (effectively how much of the complementary color is mixed in) starting from gray at the bottom to pure colors at the top. The bottom pane is arranged around the middle axis with the brightest colors, tinting with white towards the top and shading with black towards the bottom.                                  You can select an RGB color specified in either hex (#82a617) or decimal (rgb(130, 166, 23) or R119 G119 B119) format by entering it into the box bottom right. The dropdown menu top left lets you easily switch to choosing the color of other features of the selected element. You can also easily switch to selecting a custom color for a different think-cell element by selecting it on the slide. think-cell adds the most recently used custom colors to the color control for quick access. You will find a divider line in the list of most recently used colors: The colors above the divider are saved within the presentation, so you can rest assured that your colleagues have them available when editing the presentation. The colors below the divider are available on your computer only, because you were using them in a different presentation. Both sections can hold up to 8 colors. When you use a 9th custom color, the first one is removed from the list. You should use the color property when highlighting specific segments or one series in a chart. If you need to colorize an entire chart, use the color scheme property instead.3.4.2 Color scheme Pick a color scheme that applies a sequence of colors to chart features. By default, think-cell elements use the Power Point Theme color scheme. To change the color scheme of a chart, select the chart to open the mini toolbar, select the color scheme dropdown menu, then select the color scheme you want. The colors in your chart will automatically update when you add or remove data.The color scheme applies colors in sequence: the first color of the color scheme applies to the first feature in the chart and the sixth color applies to the sixth feature. The default think-cell color schemes have six colors in sequence. The color sequence resets after applying the last color: using the default color schemes, the seventh feature on your chart will use the first color of the color scheme.Note: You can customize the number of colors in a color scheme and the color scheme behavior when there are more features in a chart than there are colors in a color scheme. To learn more, see D.4.2 Choices in the color scheme control. You can use your datasheet to control the colors of your charts. To apply the cell fill colors of your Excel datasheet to your chart in Power Point, select your chart to open the mini toolbar, select the color scheme dropdown menu, then select Use Datasheet Fill on Top. Use Datasheet Fill on Top is particularly convenient if you want to highlight patterns and trends in your data through the Excel datasheet. In most charts, selecting\\xa0Use Datasheet Fill on Top applies the fill color of a cell containing a value to the corresponding feature in the chart—with two exceptions:  In area charts, the fill color of a cell containing a series label determines the corresponding area's color in the chart. In line charts, the fill color of a cell containing a series label determines the corresponding line's color in the chart. The fill color of a cell containing a value determines the corresponding marker's color in the chart. To learn more, see 3.4.8 Line scheme and 7.4 Line chart. If you enable Use Datasheet Fill on Top and a feature in your chart corresponds to a cell without a fill color, think-cell applies the selected color scheme in Power Point to that feature.You can use Conditional Formatting in Excel to change the fill color of your chart features, to have additional color control based on specific data trends. To apply cell fill colors to your chart based on conditional formatting, follow these steps: Select a range of cells, a table, or an entire sheet in Excel. These cells may contain any values, formats, formulas, and references to other cells. Select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting or think-cell > Styles > Conditional Formatting. Select one of the preset Greater Than, Less Than, Between, and Equal To formatting rules. Enter your parameters in the dialog, then select OK.  If you want to create custom formatting rules, select New Rule > Format only cells that contain > Cell Value. Enter your parameters in the dialog, then select OK. Select the linked chart in Power Point to open the mini toolbar, select the color scheme control dropdown menu, then select Use Datasheet Fill on Top. Using conditional formatting rules to affect chart colors has the following limitations: Only the Greater Than, Less Than, Between, and Equal To preset rules affect chart colors.  Only the custom rules created with New Rule > Format only cells that contain > Cell Value affect chart colors. Rules with functions or references to other cells don't affect chart colors. You can't use conditional formatting to change the number format of your charts. To change the number format of your charts using a linked Excel sheet, select the cells, then right-click and select Format Cells. To learn more, see 6.5.3 Number format. think-cell can't automatically update chart colors after you create or change conditional formatting rules in a linked Excel sheet. To update the chart, change any data value on the linked sheet or save your progress and restart Excel. To learn more, see 22. Excel data links.3.4.3 Segment sorting The segment sorting control applies a specific order to the segments in a chart. The default Segments in sheet order orders segments in the same order they appear in the datasheet. If you choose Segments in reverse sheet order the last series in the datasheet will be displayed at the top of the chart and the first series in the datasheet at the bottom of the chart. think-cell can also sort the segments in a category based on their value.  Segments in descending order  will sort all categories so that the largest segment in each category is on the baseline and sort the other segments in descending order,  Segments in ascending order  will display the segment with the smallest numerical value on the baseline. As a consequence of sorting, segments of the same data series, with the same color, will appear at different positions in different categories. Of course, these options are only available for charts that have segments. The options shown here apply to segments of column and bar, pie and doughnut, as well as Mekko charts. For area and waterfall charts only the options relating to sheet order are available.3.4.4 Category sorting The category sorting control applies a specific order to the categories in a chart. The default Categories in sheet order orders categories in the same order they appear in the datasheet. Categories in descending Y extent order will show the category with the greatest sum of values first and then sort in descending order. Categories in ascending Y extent order will show the category with the smallest sum of values first and then sort in ascending order. The options shown here apply to stacked or clustered column and bar charts, line and area charts, as well as Mekko charts. For each chart type, sorting options appropriate to that particular type are offered.3.4.5 Chart type The chart type control switches to a different chart type for displaying the same data. You can switch between the stacked, stacked 100%, clustered, area, area 100% and line chart. When using only columns or bars on an absolute axis and lines, you can also switch individual series to a different type, creating a combination chart, by selecting a segment or data point belonging to that series and switching the chart type in the mini toolbar. To switch to a 100% chart of the same basic type you can also set the Y-axis type to % (see Adjusting the value axis type).3.4.6 Line style The line style control applies to the outlines of segments of column, bar and pie charts, basic elements, agenda chapters, lines in line charts, a chart’s baseline and to value lines (see 8.2.4 Value line). You can also change a connector’s appearance using the line style control. In addition, the outline of the plot-area in all charts can be specified using the line style control.3.4.7 Outline colors You can change the color of an outline with this control. It works for segments of column, bar and pie charts as well basic elements and agenda chapters.3.4.8 Line scheme The line scheme control specifies the appearance of lines in line charts. The supported line schemes apply consistent line styles and coloring to all lines in the chart. You can also choose line schemes that highlight the data points along lines with markers.   3.4.9 Marker shape The marker shape control can be used to add or change markers for data points in line and scatter charts. Note that the marker scheme control should be used instead of marker shapes to add consistent markers to all the data points in a scatter chart.3.4.10 Marker scheme The marker scheme control applies consistent markers to data points in scatter charts. The markers are automatically updated when data points, groups and series are added or removed. The marker scheme control should be preferred over the marker shape control when adding consistent markers to an entire scatter chart.   3.4.11 Changing default colors and fonts think-cell can use Power Point’s scheme colors for many elements and features (e.g. axes, text, arrows, etc.). These colors as well as font definitions are always taken from the default colors and fonts of your presentation file. If the defaults are designed correctly, think-cell will follow seamlessly when you choose to switch the color scheme. To adjust the default (font) colors and font family, change your theme in the Design tab. think-cell elements will use the font family chosen for Body text by default. If the desired color scheme or font family is not already available as an option, you can add it as follows: For Office 2010:  In the ribbon, go to Design.  In the group Themes, click on Colors/Fonts.  From the dropdown list, choose Create New Theme Colors/Fonts.  For Office 2013 and later:  In the ribbon, go to Design.  In the group Variants, click on the downward button in the bottom right.  From the dropdown list, choose Colors/Fonts, then Customize Colors/Fonts.  In general, it is advisable to store these defaults in a Power Point template file (*.potx) and to derive all new presentations from this template file. Please refer to the Power Point help for information on how to do this. You can also specify default and additional color schemes for charts, as well as default font colors, using a think-cell style as described in C. Customizing think-cell. The specific settings for font colors are described in D.6 Customizing text properties. It is preferable to adjust default font settings in the Power Point template and a think-cell style should only be used for this purpose as a last resort, when you cannot modify your template as described above.3.5 Arrange objects3.5.1 Align objects You can use Power Point's familiar controls, for example those found in the Home  > Drawing  > Arrange menu, to position think-cell elements on the slide.  In particular, you can use the Align Left/Center/Right/Top/Middle/Bottom buttons to align one or more selected elements in relation to the slide or in relation to each other. For think-cell elements that are layout-enabled (see 14. Introduction to layout), this does not merely position them accordingly, but also introduces a snap connection between them that keeps them aligned along that edge or axis, even when they change their size or position on the slide (see 15.1 Inserting and snapping text boxes for more information). When the Align Selected Objects option is chosen in the Arrange menu, Power Point will natively align the left/right/top/bottom edge of all selected elements with that of the outermost selected element in that direction, or align their center/middle axis with that of the rectangle bounding the selection. In particular for Align Center/Middle this is often undesirable, as it means that in many cases all selected shapes will be moved, and the center/middle axis of the bounding rectangle of a selection of unaligned shapes usually has no meaning in the slide layout. As soon as at least one think-cell element is part of your multi-selection, think-cell improves upon this by using the reference object as the alignment target: When performing an alignment operation with Align Selected Objects, the chosen edge or axis of the other selected elements are aligned with the corresponding edge of the reference object (see 3.3.4 Reference object). A reference object that has a fixed position will therefore not be moved by the alignment operation.    If a multi-selection containing a think-cell element has no reference element set, the alignment behavior is the native Power Point behavior described above.3.5.2 Rotate and flip elements In the Elements menu, the small arrow markers around the pentagon/chevron and the stacked, clustered, 100%, line, combination, area, waterfall and Mekko chart symbols let you insert flipped (and—if applicable—rotated) versions of these elements. Most elements can also be rotated after insertion using a rotation handle. Simply select the element and drag the rotation handle to the desired position: Click with the left mouse button on the rotation handle and, while holding the button down, drag the handle to one of the four possible red-highlighted positions and release the button.   3.6 Resize objects When an element is selected, resize handles are shown at the corners and in the center of the boundary lines. To resize an element, drag one of these handles. While dragging the resize handle, you can press Page Up and Page Down or scroll with the mouse wheel to switch to a different slide. The outline of the element you are resizing will appear in gray, and you can use shapes on that other slide as reference points, with the same snapping behavior as explained in 3.2 Insert elements. When releasing the mouse button, you will be taken back to the original slide, where the selected size will be applied to the element. This makes it easy to align elements' positions and sizes across slides.You can also set two or more elements to the same width or height. This also works if you include Power Point shapes in your selection. First, select all objects that you want to set to the same width or height (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). Then, choose     Same Height or     \\xa0Same Width from the context menu of an element included in the selection. All objects will be resized to the same height or width, respectively.    If a reference object is set (see 3.3.4 Reference object), the height or width of all selected elements is set to its height or width. Otherwise, the largest height or width among the elements is used.                                 3.7 Zoom and pan When editing a slide in a zoomed view (like 400%) it is often hard to move the slide around and locate the region that you want to work with next. With think-cell installed, you can use the middle mouse button to “pan” the slide: Just grab the slide with your mouse pointer by clicking the middle mouse button and move it where you need it. If your mouse has a wheel instead of a middle button, you can achieve the same effect by pressing down the wheel without turning it. Note: You probably know that in Power Point you can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel with the Ctrl key held down. Together with the panning feature from think-cell, using zoomed views for slide design becomes easy and fast.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

A checkbox is an an empty box that you can mark to indicate a complete or incomplete state.A Harvey ball is a circular symbol divided into segments that range from empty to full. Harvey balls help you display more information than just a complete and incomplete state, such as the state of your progress in a project.20.1 Checkboxes To insert a checkbox, select think-cell > Elements or Insert > think-cell > Elements, then select Checkbox    . To customize a checkbox, select the checkbox to open the mini toolbar. In the mini toolbar, you can change the format of a checkbox, such as the size, check mark color, or outline color. To learn more, see 6.5.1 Font, 3.4.1 Color and fill, and 3.4.6 Line style.                                 You can change a checkbox into a Harvey ball with the mini toolbar. To change a checkbox into a Harvey ball, select the checkbox to open the mini toolbar, then select     .20.1.1 Change the status of a checkbox You can change the status of a checkbox with the mini toolbar or your keyboard and mouse. To change the status with the mini toolbar, click the checkbox. In the mini toolbar, in the second dropdown menu, select check mark (✓), X mark (✗), or a clear checkbox (☐). To change the status with the keyboard, select the following: To enter a check mark (✓), select the checkbox, then select v, o, or 1. To enter a X mark (✗), select the checkbox, then select x or 2. To clear the checkbox (☐), select the checkbox, then select Space or 0. To switch between a check mark (✓), X mark (✗), or a clear checkbox (☐), double-click the checkbox. 20.2 Harvey balls To insert a Harvey ball, select think-cell > Elements or Insert > think-cell > Elements, then select Harvey Ball     . To customize a Harvey ball, select the Harvey ball to open the mini toolbar. In the mini toolbar, you can change the format of a Harvey ball, such as the size, segment fill color, or outline color. To learn more, see 6.5.1 Font, 3.4.1 Color and fill, and 3.4.6 Line style.                                 You can change a Harvey ball into a checkbox with the mini toolbar. To change a Harvey ball into a checkbox, select the Harvey ball to open the mini toolbar, then select     .20.2.1 Change the progress state Progress state refers to the filled segments of a Harvey ball. To change the progress state with the mini toolbar, click the checkbox. In the mini toolbar, in the second dropdown menu, select the progress state you want. To change the progress state the keyboard and mouse, select the following: To increase the progress state, select the Harvey ball, then select +. Alternatively, double-click the Harvey ball. To decrease the progress state, select the Harvey ball, then select -.  To change to a specific progress state on a Harvey ball with eight or fewer segments, select the Harvey ball, then select 1 to 8.  To change to a specific progress state on a Harvey ball with more than eight segments, change the progress state in fractions of eight by selecting 1 to 8. For example, on a Harvey ball with 100 total segments, select 6 to fill six-eighths of the segments, for a 75% progress state. 20.2.2 Change the number of segments To change the number of segments, select the Harvey ball to open the mini toolbar.

Discover your library and new tools. F. API documentation        Resources     Manual    API documentation   think-cell allows you to programatically control some functionality through an API. Here you can find an overview over all available API functions, and general instruction for how to setup your development environment to write macros, add-ins, or standalone programs that access them.Contents F.1 Getting started think-cell\\'s API is integrated into the Office Automation model, so it can be accessed from any language with which you can program Office, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or C#. The entry point into think-cell is the think-cell add-in object. It can be accessed via the Application.COM Add Ins collection. Calls into think-cell are always late-bound, thus there is no type library or reference to add. See Microsoft’s knowledge base for an explanation:Using early binding and late binding in Automation Some API functions are methods of the think-cell add-in object in Power Point, and some of the think-cell add-in object in Excel. We will use tc Pp Add In for references to the Power Point add-in, and tc Xl Add In for references to the Excel add-in.F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications To write macros using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), you use the development environment integrated into the Office host application. This can be accessed by pressing Alt+F11. The definition of a macro is usually contained in a module, which you can add via Insert > Module. You can view all macros defined for a given document by pressing Alt+F8. To indicate that method calls into the think-cell add-in are late-bound, you need to declare the variable containing the reference to it as Object: The type library for the Office host application is always referenced by default. If you need to access the object model of another Office application, you need to add its type library as a reference. For example, if you want to use a macro in Power Point to manipulate data in an Excel sheet before updating a think-cell chart from it, you need to manually add the Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library via the Tools      > References dialog in the VBA development environment. Note: 16.0 is the version number of Office 2016 and later. For Office 2010 or 2013, you need to use the 14.0 or 15.0 object libraries, respectively. If you have multiple versions of Office installed, the References dialog will only show the object libraries of the latest version installed. We will assume in the following that you are using Office 2016 or later. Using Application.COM Add Ins(\"thinkcell.addin\").Object will always get you the think-cell add-in object of the current Office host application, that is tc Pp Add In or tc Xl Add In, depending on whether you use it in Power Point or Excel. To acquire a reference to the add-in object in the other Office application, and access the API functions it exposes, acquire it through an appropriate application instance. For example, to acquire a reference to tc Xl Add In from Power Point: Note that this requires the Excel object library to be added as as a reference. We recommend using the Option Explicit statement, which forces the explicit declaration of all variables, thereby helping to avoid common programming errors and improving the suggestions provided by Intelli Sense. You can have it automatically added to all modules by activating Tools      > Options > Code Settings > Require Variable Declaration. It is included in all our code samples.F.1.2 C# You can use the think-cell API from C# when developing add-ins and document code extensions running inside an Office host application, as well as when developing standalone applications. We will assume in the following that you are using Visual Studio 2017 or later to develop Office solutions in C#. Refer to the next section for more specific setup instructions for add-in development. With each of our code samples, we will indicate which Visual Studio project template to use. To make method calls to the think-cell add-in object late-bound, declare the variable containing the reference to the think-cell add-in object as dynamic; this is also the type inferred by the compiler when declaring the reference as var, so that you can simply write: Here ppapp is a reference to a Power Point Application object in which think-cell is loaded. To access the object model of an Office application, you need to add either its type library or its primary interop assembly (PIA) as a reference to your project. We recommend adding the type library if possible, since Visual Studio will automatically add a reference to the corresponding PIA, if one is available, or generate an interop assembly from the type library if there is none (see here). For example, to be able to get the reference to the think-cell add-in object as above, you would add the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library found in the COM > Type Libraries tab of the Reference Manager dialog. Depending on your project type, this dialog is accessed either by right-clicking References or Dependencies in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add (COM) Reference. Note: 16.0 is the version number of Office 2016 and later. By using the Embed Interop Types option, which is enabled by default for a reference to a COM type library, an application compiled with this reference will be backward (and forward) compatible with other versions of Office as long as all interfaces used exist in their object model. See here for more information. think-cell\\'s API functions indicate errors using COM HRESUL Ts. Some of these are automatically mapped onto corresponding .NET exception classes, see  How to: Map HRESUL Ts and Exceptions .To develop add-ins for Office, or code extensions for Office documents, you use the Power Point/Excel VSTO Add-in and Excel VSTO Template/Workbook project templates. These are part of the Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio, which are installed as part of the default configuration. Should these tools and templates not be available in your Visual Studio installation, you can add them, for example, by going to Settings⚙ > Apps > Visual Studio 2022 > Modify > Other Toolsets, checking Office/Share Point development and clicking Modify. See also Microsoft\\'s documentation here.The PIA for the Office host application of the selected template is always loaded by default. If you need to access the object model of another Office application, you need to add its type library as a reference as explained above.Note: think-cell\\'s API cannot be used from Office Web Add-Ins—unfortunately now simply called \"Office Add-ins\" by Microsoft—as they cannot interact with the Office application\\'s object model directly, and in particular cannot interact with COM add-ins such as think-cell.F.2 API reference F.2.1 Updating elements and presentation templates with Excel data F.2.2 Controlling styles F.2.3 Importing Mekko Graphics charts F.2.4 Miscellaneous F.2.1 Updating elements and presentation templates with Excel data The functions in this section can be used to programatically update think-cell elements, usually placeholders in a presentation template, with data from Excel. Update Chart updates think-cell elements, specified by a name assigned to it in the template, with data from an Excel range passed as an argument. See also 25. Introduction to automation for how to prepare the template. Presentation From Template instantiates a presentation template with data from a linked Excel workbook. See also 22. Excel data links for how to create Excel links. The functions in this section are methods of the think-cell add-in in Excel. This function updates all elements in target with name str Name with the data contained in rg Data. For the data to be interpreted correctly for charts, the range rg Data must conform to their configured datasheet layout, or its transposed version, see also 22.1 Creating a chart from Excel and 22.2 Fitting the data layout. Whether the default or the transposed version is to be used is indicated by setting b Transposed to false or true, respectively. For elements other than charts, tables for example, the value of b Transposed is ignored. target must be a Presentation or Slide Range, or a single Slide, Master or Custom Layout. The name str Name is matched case-insensitively. It must have been previously assigned in Power Point using the Update Chart Name property control as described in 25. Introduction to automation. To ensure that the correct elements are targeted, make sure that they are the only ones with their Update Chart Name set to str Name in the object passed as pres. If a targeted element is linked to an Excel data range when invoking this function, the link is broken. Afterwards, the element will not be linked to any Excel range. To use these samples, prepare a presentation as described in 25. Introduction to automation, and save it as C:\\\\Samples\\\\Update Chart\\\\template.pptx. To use this sample add it to a module in an Excel workbook. It requires a reference to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details). Running Update Chart_Sample in a workbook will update the chart in the presentation template with the data contained in range A1:D5 of its first sheet. To use this sample, replace the code in Program.cs of the C# Console App project template with it. It requires references to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library, the Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library and the Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.2 C# for details). Running the resulting application will update the chart in the presentation template to contain a single series named \"Series 1\" with values 1, 2, 3, and save the result as template_updated.pptx. This function uses the data links between the Excel workbook wb and the template with filename str Template to instantiate that template by updating the linked elements with the data from the ranges they are linked to. The result is a new presentation within the Power Point instance ppapp. str Template can either be a full path or a relative path, which is then taken to be relative to the location of the Excel workbook file wb. All elements in str Template that are linked to the Excel workbook wb are updated (regardless whether they are set to auto-update or not). In the resulting presentation, their data links are broken to prevent further changes to these elements. Elements in str Template which are linked to Excel workbooks other than wb are left unchanged and still linked, so it is possible to update links from multiple Excel workbooks by saving the result of this function as a new template and then calling this function again with the next workbook. If you want to control the colors of chart segments or the formatting of table cells with the Excel link, you can set the color scheme to Use Datasheet Fill on Top (see 3.4.2 Color scheme) or the Use Datasheet... options (see 17.3 Formatting a table), respectively. Likewise, to control the number format with the Excel link, set it to Use Excel Format (see 6.5.3 Number format). Make sure to set the relevant formatting options and the number format of the respective cells in Excel before calling Presentation From Template. To use these samples, first create a presentation containing a stacked chart linked to the range G1:K4 of the first sheet in an Excel workbook as explained in 22.1 Creating a chart from Excel. Save the resulting presentation as C:\\\\Samples\\\\Presentation From Template\\\\template.pptx and the workbook as data.xlsx in the same directory. To use this sample, add it to a module in the Excel workbook data.xlsx prepared as explained above. It requires a reference to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details). Running Presentation From Template_Sample will change the value in cell Sheet1!H3, which is linked to the first value of the first series of the chart contained in template.pptx, from i=1 to 10, create a new presentation with the chart in the template updated to contain that value, and which is not linked to the workbook anymore, and save it as output_i.pptx in the same directory as the template. To use this sample replace the code in Program.cs of the C# Console App project template with it. It requires references to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library, the Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library and the Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.2 C# for details). Running the resulting application will visibly open Excel, load the workbook data.xlsx, change the value in cell H3, which is linked to the first value of the first series of the chart contained in template.pptx, from i=1 to 10, create a new presentation with the chart in the template updated to contain that value, and which is not linked to the workbook anymore, and save it as output_i.pptx in the same directory as the template.F.2.2 Controlling styles The functions in this section can be used to programmatically load, inspect, and remove think-cell styles. Load Style loads a style from a style file into a slide master or a single layout. Load Style For Region loads a style from a style file into a specific region of a layout. Get Style Name returns the name of the style loaded into a slide master or layout. Remove Styles removes all styles from a layout. See C.1 Create a think-cell style and D. Style file format for more information on creating and editing styles. See C.2 Load style files for more information on loading them. The functions in this section are methods of the think-cell add-in in Power Point.This function loads the style contained in the style file at File Name into a slide master or layout, specified via the parameter Custom Layout Or Master.Custom Layout Or Master must be a Custom Layout or Master.When applied to a layout where a regional style has been set (see F.2.2.2 Load Style For Region), the regional style will be removed. This means that you need to load the style that should apply on the rest of the slide using this function before you load a style restricted to a region.When applied to a slide master, any styles loaded into the layouts contained in that master, regional and unrestricted, will be removed. This means that you need to load the style that should apply to layouts without a specific style into the slide master before loading a style applying to a specific layout using this function. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).This function loads the style file at File Name into the slide layout Custom Layout and restricts it to a region given by Left, Top, Width, Height. On the rest of the slide, the style loaded into the slide master or the one previously loaded into the layout with Load Style applies.The parameters Left, Top, Width, Height are given in Power Point points. Left and Top specify the distance of the left and top edges of the region from the left and top edges of the layout, respectively. Usually you will set them as fractions of the total slide height and width. For example, for a region covering the right two-thirds of the layout, you would set You can also manually add a shape to a slide or layout, query its properties Left, Top, Width, Height programmatically and use the values with Load Style For Region to restrict the style to the same region covered by the shape.think-cell supports a maximum of two styles per layout. One is set with Load Style and covers everything not restricted to a region, the other is set with Load Style For Region. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).Available from think-cell 14 onwards. This function returns the name of the style loaded into the Custom Layout or Master Custom Layout Or Master. This is the same name that is specified in the name attribute of the <style> element of the corresponding style file (see D.2.1 style). It returns an empty string when no style is loaded into Custom Layout Or Master. Note that a slide master always has a style loaded into it when think-cell is active and that the name of a style cannot be empty. If a name is returned for a Custom Layout, it is the name of the style loaded into it with F.2.2.1 Load Style, not of the one loaded with F.2.2.2 Load Style For Region, if any. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).This function removes all styles from the slide layout Custom Layout. Afterwards, the style loaded into the slide master applies. Potentially, there can be a style loaded into the layout and another style restricted to a specific region of the layout. As Remove Styles removes all styles, both will be removed. The style loaded into a slide master cannot be removed, as there always needs to be a valid style associated with a master. It can be overwritten with a different style file. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).F.2.3 Importing Mekko Graphics charts The functions in this section can be used to programmatically import and inspect charts created with Mekko Graphics to think-cell. Import Mekko Graphics Charts replaces Mekko Graphics charts with equivalent think-cell charts. Get Mekko Graphics XML extracts the XML definition of a Mekko Graphics chart. The functions in this section are methods of the think-cell add-in in Power Point.Available from think-cell 14 onwards. This function replaces all Mekko Graphics charts in the array of Shapes passed to it with an equivalent think-cell chart. The shapes must all be on the same slide. Before modifying the slide, the function will make a copy of the unmodified slide and insert it directly after the modified version. The function returns a reference to this copy, if one was made. It returns Nothing/null, if the presentation was not modified, for example because the array did not contain any Mekko Graphics charts. To use this sample, add it to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details). Running Import All on a presentation will go through the slides in the presentation and replace all visible Mekko Graphics charts with equivalent think-cell charts, making a copy of each slide containing one before modifying it. To use this sample, add this method to the This Add In class of the C# Power Point VSTO Add-in project template (see F.1.2 C# and F.1.2.1 Add-in development for details). Add the following line to the This Add In_Startup method to run Import All on each presentation that is opened:Available from think-cell 14 onwards. This function returns the XML of the Mekko Graphics chart in shp as a string. It does not modify the shape passed to it. If shp is not a Mekko Graphics chart, an E_INVALIDARG (0x80070057) error is raised. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details). To use this sample replace the code in Program.cs of a Console App with it. It requires references to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library and Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.2 C# for details). Running the application will go through the presentation in C:\\\\Samples\\\\Get Mekko Graphics XML\\\\presentation.pptx and print the XML of the Mekko Graphics charts contained in it to the console.F.2.4 Miscellaneous The functions in this section are methods of the think-cell add-in in Power Point.Available from think-cell 14 onwards. Calling this method has the same effect as clicking Table in the Elements menu in Power Point.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3. Basic concepts   Charting   4.

Discover your library and new tools. 11. Pie and doughnut chart        Resources     Manual    Pie and doughnut chart  Icon in Elements menu:      A pie chart or doughnut chart is actually a special case of a 100% chart with only one category (column) of data.    The doughnut chart shows a circular, unfilled area in the middle of the chart.    Each slice of a pie chart or doughnut chart shows three handles, when selected. Each of the handles can be dragged with the mouse to rotate the pie. When rotating, the handles snap at positions 0∘, 90∘, 180∘ and 270∘, making it easy to create an aesthetically pleasing layout. The pie chart or doughnut chart remembers which handle you were dragging when rotating the chart and preserves the correct orientation even when the data is changed. In addition, you can drag the handles away from the pie in order to emphasize the respective pie slice.    You can drag a handle to change the size of the hole in the doughnut chart.    By changing the size to 0%, you change the doughnut chart into a pie chart. You can also use this handle to create a hole in a pie chart, turning it into a doughnut chart. The labels of the pie chart or doughnut chart support the label content property, which lets you choose if you want to display absolute values, percentages, or both (6.5.5 Label content). Additionally you can move each outer label to place it anywhere on the outer edge of the respective slice.    To add a title label to a doughnut chart, use     \\xa0Add Title from its context menu. Universal connectors can be used to connect pie charts or doughnut charts with other chart types (see 8.2.7 Universal connectors).Introduction   1. Search in manual     2.

Discover your library and new tools. C. Customizing think-cell        Resources     Manual    Customizing think-cell   This chapter describes how to customize think-cell, i.e., how to change default colors and other default properties; this is done via think-cell\\'s style files, which are treated in the first four sections. The fifth section, C.5 Set a default agenda slide layout, explains how to create custom Agenda slide layouts, and the sixth, C.6 Customize the think-cell ribbon, explains how to customize think-cell\\'s user interface using Power Point\\'s Ribbon customization options. The following properties can be changed using style files:  The list of available colors and patterns (see 3.4.1 Color and fill).    The list of available color schemes (see 3.4.2 Color scheme).    The colors of Harvey ball and checkbox (see 20. Checkboxes and Harvey balls).    Predefined slide layouts for placing charts (see D.7 Predefining slide layouts for placing charts). These slide layouts will be shown as thumbnails in the top left corner of the slide view when a chart of the relevant type is selected for insertion or dragged on the slide, and clicking on, or dragging it to, one of the rectangular areas in the thumbnail will place the chart with that position and size. This can be used together with slide templates to ensure consistent positioning of charts.    The option to use a fiscal calendar in Gantt charts (see 13.1.2 Scale display).    The list of available lines styles (see 3.4.6 Line style).  The list of available markers for line charts and scatter charts (see 3.4.9 Marker shape).  The first three sections describe creating and loading a style file and explain how to deploy it in an organization. An understanding of these tasks is required in any case. Afterwards, you may either follow the C.4 Style file tutorial to create your own style file or go through the format reference in D. Style file format.Contents C.1 Create a think-cell style Simple modifications to an existing style file can be made using any text editor. A new think-cell style file should be created using a dedicated XML editor. It will support you by automatically checking for errors and making suggestions on how to solve them. Our recommendation for such an editor and tips for setting it up is described at KB0191: Recommended setup for editing think-cell style files A dedicated XML editor will typically highlight errors in your document, and with a keyboard shortcut such as Ctrl-Spacebar you can trigger auto completion: the editor will offer a choice of tags, attributes or values applicable to the current context (position of the text cursor). If you move the mouse over highlighted errors, you will get a tooltip with a detailed explanation of the error. Several sample style files are delivered together with think-cell and you can find them in the subdirectory styles of the think-cell installation directory. First, find out the location of the installation directory. It is shown when you click About in the     Tools menu.    Open this directory and go to the subdirectory styles, e.g.,C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\think-cell\\\\styles Open the file generic style.xml. It should look like this:    The editor automatically checks your file for errors. You can display an error list by clicking on View > Error List:    Make sure that there are no warnings or errors indicated before you save an edited style file. Of course, any other editor that supports XML also works. The file needs to be saved with an .xml extension.C.2 Load style files To load a style file, choose Load Style File... from the menu     Tools. In the dialog, navigate to the location of the style file, choose the file and click Open. It is used for any new charts in the current presentation. For example, after you load the sample style file example_style_complex.xml from the styles directory in think-cell’s installation directory, the color and color scheme property controls will include customized items.    If you want to apply a style’s colors or color schemes in existing charts, you need to do so manually.C.2.1 Load style files programmatically You can also load style files programmatically, for example as part of a workflow that prepares new or updated templates. The greater precision of API calls also enables to specify additional options when loading a style file, like targeting a specific custom layout or even restricting the style to a rectangular region of a custom layout, as well as removing them from custom layouts and inspecting the name of the style loaded into a master or custom layout. think-cell\\'s API is integrated into the Office Automation model, so it can be accessed from any language with which you can program Office, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or C#. See F.1 Getting started for detailed instructions. Suppose you have a custom layout that uses different background colors for the left and right side of the slide. The right side matches the background of the rest of your presentation, so it is fine that the style set in the master applies here. However, the left side uses a different background, for which a modified style is appropriate. In this situation, you would use Load Style to set one style file for the whole presentation. Next, you would use Load Style For Region to set a different style for only the left side of the appropriate custom layout. The following sections describe the available API calls. They are methods of the think-cell add-in object in Power Point.C.2.2 Load Style This function loads the style contained in the style file at File Name into a master or custom layout, specified via the parameter Custom Layout Or Master. Custom Layout Or Master must be a Custom Layout or Master. When applied to a custom layout where a regional style has been set (see C.2.3 Load Style For Region), the regional style will be removed. This means that you need to load the style that should apply on the rest of the slide using this function before you load a style restricted to a region. When applied to a master, any styles loaded into the custom layouts contained in that master, regional and unrestricted, will be removed. This means that you need to load the style that should apply to custom layouts without a specific style into the master before loading a style applying to a specific custom layout using this function. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).C.2.3 Load Style For Region This function loads the style file at File Name into the custom layout Custom Layout and restricts it to a region given by Left, Top, Width, Height. On the rest of the slide, the style loaded into the master, or the one previously loaded into the custom layout with Load Style applies. The parameters Left, Top, Width, Height are given in Power Point points. Left and Top specify the distance of the left and top edges of the region from the left and top edges of the custom layout, respectively. Usually you will set them as fractions of the total slide height and width. For example, for a region covering the right two thirds of the custom layout, you would set You can also manually add a shape to a slide or custom layout, query its properties Left, Top, Width, Height programmatically and use the values with Load Style For Region to restrict the style to the same region covered by the shape. think-cell supports a maximum of two styles per custom layout. One is set with Load Style and covers everything not restricted to a region, the other is set with Load Style For Region. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).C.2.4 Remove Styles This function removes all styles from the custom layout Custom Layout. Afterwards, the style loaded into the master applies. Potentially, there can be a style loaded into the custom layout and another style restricted to a specific region of the custom layout. As Remove Styles removes all styles, both will be removed. The style loaded into a master cannot be removed, as there always needs to be a valid style associated with a master. It can be overwritten with a different style file. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).C.2.5 Get Style Name Supported in think-cell 13 and later. This function returns the name of the style loaded into the Custom Layout or Master or Custom Layout Or Master. This is the same name that is specified in the name attribute of the <style> element of the corresponding style file (see D.2.1 style). It returns an empty string when no style is loaded into Custom Layout Or Master. Note that a master always has a style loaded into it when think-cell is active and that the name of a style cannot be empty. If a name is returned for a Custom Layout, it is the name of the style loaded into it with C.2.2 Load Style, not of the one loaded with C.2.3 Load Style For Region, if any. To use this sample, add the following code to a module in Power Point (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details).C.3 Deploy think-cell styles Load Style File... in the     Tools menu in the think-cell toolbar loads a style file into the master slide of the current presentation. When the presentation is distributed as a Power Point template, the think-cell style is implicitly distributed as well. Switching between styles is accomplished by switching between Power Point templates. It should not be necessary to give a think-cell style file to individual users. We recommend to distribute your think-cell style together with your Power Point template. Typically both are needed to implement your corporate design and deploying them as one is the easiest option for users. If it is not possible to follow our recommendation to deploy the think-cell style as part of your Power Point template, a default style file can be specified with the defaultstyle configuration parameter (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters). The parameter value is the path name to a valid style file. The path can either be absolute or relative to the styles subdirectory of the think-cell installation directory. The default style file is loaded automatically on two occasions:  When a new presentation is created.  When an existing presentation is opened that does not currently contain a style. When this presentation is saved and subsequently opened again, it will now contain a style, so the default style is not loaded again.  The default style file that will be loaded automatically is highlighted with an appended (default) in the list of available and recently loaded style files:   C.4 Style file tutorial In think-cell’s installation directory (usually C:\\\\Program Files\\\\think-cell), in the subdirectory styles, you can find the style file generic style.xml. This style mirrors the colors and color schemes that are available immediately after installation when no style is loaded. Therefore:  Make a copy of generic style.xml and load it into an XML editor (see C.1 Create a think-cell style for choosing a suitable editor).  Walk through the file from top to bottom making the changes described in the following steps.  Remove any unneeded colors from the list inside the fill Lst element. You will find solid Fill, patt Fill and separator elements corresponding to the items in the color list displayed in think-cell (see 3.4.1 Color and fill). To remove, e.g., a solid Fill element, remove everything between and including the opening tag <solid Fill ...> and the closing tag </solid Fill>.  Optionally, create a new section for your own colors. To do this, insert a separator tag by writing <separator/> at the appropriate location in the color list. Also, feel free to use line breaks, indentation and empty lines to structure the XML code in the style file for your own convenience. Spaces and linebreaks have no effect on the resulting style.  Add your own colors using the solid Fill element. Your color needs a name and values for the red, green and blue channels. You should have these values from the specification document for your company’s corporate identity. If the color’s name should be “Light Green”, the decimal value for the red channel 170, for green 255 and for blue 42, then it should look like this:                                         <solid Fill\\xa0name=\"Light\\xa0Green\">  \\xa0\\xa0<sdrgb Clr\\xa0r=\"170\"\\xa0g=\"255\"\\xa0b=\"42\"/>  </solid Fill>  Remove any unneeded color schemes from the list inside the fill Scheme Lst element. You will find fill Scheme elements corresponding to the items in the color scheme list displayed in think-cell (see 3.4.2 Color scheme. To remove a fill Scheme element, remove everything between and including the opening tag <fill Scheme ...> and the closing tag </fill Scheme>.  Optionally, modify an existing color scheme. You can  remove one or multiple colors from the scheme by removing the respective fill Ref elements or  reorder the existing colors by reordering fill Ref elements or  include one of your own colors by adding a fill Ref element inside the fill Scheme element at the appropriate place. If you wish to include the color defined above, add the following line:                                                 <fill Ref\\xa0name=\"Light\\xa0Green\"/>  Note that you can only use colors that have been defined in the fill Lst section (see steps 3.-5.) above. In particular, if you removed any colors in step 3., you must remove those colors from the color schemes, too.  Optionally, create a new color scheme using the fill Scheme element. Your scheme needs a name, e.g., “Green Scheme”, a color reference to be used by the other series in the required attribute fill Scheme Lst, and a list of color references as fill Ref elements. If you had defined the colors “Orange”, “Dark Green”, and “Medium Green” in addition to “Light Green” above, your color scheme might look like this:                                         <fill Scheme\\xa0name=\"Green\\xa0Scheme\" fill Ref Other Series=\"Orange\">  \\xa0\\xa0<fill Ref\\xa0name=\"Dark\\xa0Green\"/>  \\xa0\\xa0<fill Ref\\xa0name=\"Medium\\xa0Green\"/>  \\xa0\\xa0<fill Ref\\xa0name=\"Light\\xa0Green\"/>  </fill Scheme>  Check the contents of the fill Scheme Ref Default element. The name attribute specifies the color scheme that is used by default when inserting new charts. If you wish to set your own color scheme as the new default, modify the code like this:                                         <fill Scheme Ref Default\\xa0name=\"Green\\xa0scheme\"/>  Save the modified style file, load it (see C.2 Load style files) and test it.  Deploy the new style in your organization as described in C.3 Deploy think-cell styles. In particular, it is not necessary to send the XML file to your colleagues, but you should of course keep it for your own reference. C.5 Set a default agenda slide layout The think-cell agenda can use a specific custom layout in your presentation to define the agenda position and other shapes on an agenda slide like headers or pictures. By adding this custom layout to a template, you can define these settings for a whole organization.  In Power Points slide master view, create a new custom layout. Typically, you will duplicate one of the existing custom layouts that best match the desired look of a think-cell agenda slide.  Name the new custom layout “think-cell agenda”. think-cell will only use this custom layout, if it exactly matches this name, which is case-sensitive.  Only include shapes on the “think-cell agenda” custom layout that should appear like this on every agenda slide.  While editing the custom layout, choose     \\xa0Agenda Placeholder from the Elements menu. This element is only available when editing a custom layout. It adds an agenda placeholder on the current custom layout.  Choose the agenda placeholder position as described in 19.3 Placing the agenda.  When a custom layout created this way and named “think-cell agenda” is found in the current presentation,     \\xa0Chapter will use this custom layout, including any additional shapes on it and place the agenda at the pre-set position.C.6 Customize the think-cell ribbonthink-cell adds controls—that is, commands, groups, and tabs—to the Power Point and Excel ribbons. You can customize which think-cell controls appear on the ribbon, their position on the ribbon, and their names. To learn more about customizing the ribbon, see Microsoft Support.If your organization has its own ribbon customization, this customization may override your changes to the ribbon the next time that you open Power Point or Excel.    For administrators To customize a default think-cell ribbon for users in your organization, see A.5 Configure the Power Point and Excel ribbons.C.6.1 Customize think-cell ribbon controls    Windows only You can customize the think-cell controls on the Power Point and Excel ribbons. For example, you can reorder controls for easier access to your most-used commands, rename controls, and remove controls that you rarely use.To customize the think-cell ribbon controls, follow these steps: Open the app whose ribbon you want to customize—that is, Power Point or Excel. On the ribbon, right-click any empty space and select Customize the Ribbon.

For Mac users Adding your assets to the library on Mac isn't yet fully supported. To add a folder from your local Mac, first add the folder to the library on Windows, then copy the folder to your Mac. To add a network drive or folder inside the drive, ensure that someone has previously added this source to the library on Windows.If you add, edit, or delete assets in a local Mac folder, these updates do not automatically appear in the library. The library only automatically updates a folder if someone has added and updated this folder on Windows.When you add assets to the think-cell Library, your data stays where it is: think-cell neither uploads your files to a cloud service nor copies them to another location. If the files are stored locally on your computer, you can access them in the library even when you're offline.The library also preserves user permissions for files. Users who can't access a file in your company network can't see that file in the library either. Additionally, the index files (.tcidx) and database files (.tcidxdb) that think-cell generates when you add assets to the library have the same user permissions as the files that they index.You can add slides and images with the following formats to the library.ContentÂ\\xa0type Supported formats Slides.pptx, .ppt, .pptm, .potx, .pot,.potm, .ppsx, .pps, .ppsm Images.jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .svg, .tiff, .webp, .emf, .wmf, .heic, .heics, .arw, .dng, .cr2, .nef, .nrw, .pef, .raf, .rw2, .srw    For administrators If one of these image formats doesn't work in the library, check that the corresponding image codec is installed.

Discover your library and new tools. 23. Excel tools        Resources     Manual    Excel tools  In Excel, think-cell adds ribbon commands that make it easier to prepare and format your data before you present it in Power Point using think-cell elements. These think-cell tools are also useful independently in Excel.The built-in Excel rounding tool can make the result of calculations appear incorrect, because Excel can only consider each cell value individually. The think-cell 23.2 Excel data rounding functions consider calculations holistically and round in such a way that the deviation from the precise values is minimal while keeping the calculation correct using the rounded values, where this is mathematically possible. think-cell also allows you to apply table styles defined in Excel as regular formatting with a single click to a selected range of cells, without turning that range into a table. See 23.4 Applying Excel table styles as regular formatting.23.1 The think-cell ribbon in Excel After installing think-cell, you can use think-cell commands on the Excel ribbon.The think-cell ribbon tab contains think-cell and Excel commands organized from left to right to reflect the process of working with data.If you don\\'t see the think-cell tab, your organization may have its own ribbon configuration and can provide related support. In many cases, you can go to Insert > think-cell to find frequently used think-cell commands. The Formulas tab may also contain think-cell commands.You can customize the think-cell ribbon in Excel. For more information, see the following topics: Customize the think-cell tab (Windows only) Remove the think-cell tab Customize the ribbon in Office (Microsoft Support) 23.2 Excel data rounding When data is compiled for a report or Power Point presentation, rounding summations in Excel is a frequent problem. It is often desirable, but difficult to achieve, that rounded totals exactly match the total of the rounded addends. For example, consider the following table:    When the values are rounded to integers using Excel’s Format-Cell function, the following table results. Totals which appear to be “miscalculated” are in bold:    Similarly, when Excel’s standard rounding functions are used, totals of the rounded values are calculated correctly but rounding errors accumulate and results often deviate substantially from the actual totals of the original values. The following table shows the result of =ROUND(x,0) for the example above. Totals that deviate from the original value by 1 or more are in bold:    Using think-cell round, you can achieve consistently rounded totals with minimal “cheating”: While most values are rounded to the nearest integer, a few values are rounded in the opposite direction, thus maintaining correct calculations without accumulating rounding error. Since there are many possibilities to achieve correctly rounded totals by changing values, the software picks a solution that requires the minimum number of values changed and the minimum deviation from the precise values. For example, rounding down 10.5 to 10 is preferable over rounding down 3.7 to 3. The following table shows an optimal solution for the above example, with “cheated” values in bold:    To achieve this output in your own calculation, simply select the concerned range of Excel cells. Then, click the     button on the Formulas tab and, if necessary, adjust the rounding precision using the toolbar’s dropdown box.23.2.1 Using think-cell round think-cell round seamlessly integrates into Microsoft Excel, providing a set of functions that are similar to Excel’s standard rounding functions. You can easily apply these functions to your own data using the think-cell round ribbon group in the Formulas tab.    Like the Excel functions, the think-cell rounding functions take two parameters:x The value that is to be rounded. This can be a constant, a formula or a reference to another cell.n The rounding precision. The meaning of this parameter depends on the function you use. The parameters for the think-cell functions are the same as for the equivalent Excel functions. Refer to the table below for examples. think-cell round can not only round to integer values, but to any multiple. For example, if you want to represent your data in 5-10-15-... steps, simply round to multiples of five. Using the dropdown box in the think-cell round toolbar, simply type in or select the desired rounding precision. think-cell round chooses the appropriate function and parameters for you. The following table provides some examples of rounding certain x-values using the toolbar together with their specific n-parameter. x\\xa0= n\\xa0= 10050210.011.01800211.021700181717.0054.610050545554.601234.123412001250123412341234.128776.5432188008800877687778776.54 If the values are not displayed the way you expect them to, verify that the Excel Cell Formatting is set to General and the columns are wide enough to display all decimal places.Button Formula Description    TCROUND(x, n) Let think-cell round decide to which of the two nearest multiples to round to minimize rounding error.    TCROUNDUP(x, n) Force rounding of x away from zero.    TCROUNDDOWN(x, n) Force rounding of x towards zero.    TCROUNDNEAR(x, n) Force rounding of x to the nearest multiple of the desired precision.    Remove all think-cell round functions from the selected cells.    Select or type the desired rounding multiple.    Highlight all cells which think-cell decided to round to the farther of the two closest multiples instead of to the nearest. For optimal results with as little deviation from the underlying values as possible, you should use TCROUND wherever possible. Only use the more restrictive functions TCROUNDDOWN, TCROUNDUP or TCROUNDNEAR if you must. Attention: You should never use nondeterministic functions like RAND() within any of the TCROUND formulas. If functions return a different value every time they are evaluated, think-cell round will make mistakes calculating values. The rectangular layout of the example above is only for sake of demonstration. You can use the TCROUND functions to determine the display of arbitrary summations spread across your Excel sheet. Excel’s 3-D references to other sheets and links to other files do also work. Since TCROUND functions are meant to control the output of a cell, they must be the outermost function:Bad: =TCROUND(A1, 1)+TCROUND(SUM(B1:E1), 1)Good:=TCROUND(A1+SUM(B1:E1), 1)\\xa0Bad:=3*TCROUNDDOWN(A1, 1)Good: =TCROUNDDOWN(3*A1, 1) If you happen to enter something along the lines of the bad examples, think-cell round will notify you with the Excel error value #VALUE!.23.2.2 Limitations of think-cell round think-cell round always finds a solution for arbitrary summations with subtotals and totals. think-cell round also provides sensible solutions for some other calculations involving multiplication and numerical functions. However, for mathematical reasons, the existence of a consistently rounded solution cannot be guaranteed as soon as operators other than +, - and SUM are used. In many cases, think-cell round produces good results when constant multiplication is involved, i.e., at most one of the coefficients is derived from the result of another TCROUND function. Consider the following example:    The precise calculation for cell C1 is 3×1.3+1.4=5.3. This result can be met by rounding up the value 1.4 to 2:    However, think-cell round can only “cheat” by rounding up or rounding down. Further deviation from the original values is not supported. Thus, for certain combinations of input values, no consistently rounded solution can be found. In this case, the function TCROUND evaluates to the Excel error value #NUM!. The following example illustrates an unsolvable problem:    The precise calculation for cell C1 is 6×1.3+1.4=9.2. Rounding cells A1 and B1 would result in 6×1+2=8 or 6×2+1=13. The actual result 9.2 cannot be rounded to 8 or 13, and the output from think-cell round looks like this:    Note: The Excel function AVERAGE is interpreted by think-cell round as a combination of summation and constant multiplication. Also, a summation where the same addend appears more than once is mathematically equivalent to a constant multiplication, and the existence of a solution is not guaranteed. As long as the TCROUND functions are used for all relevant cells and intermediate results are connected merely by +, -, SUM and AVERAGE, the addends as well as (intermediate) totals are integrated into a single rounding problem. In these cases, think-cell round will find a solution that provides consistency throughout all cells involved, if such a solution exists. Since TCROUND is a normal Excel function, it can be combined with arbitrary functions and operators. But when you use functions other than the ones mentioned above to connect results from TCROUND statements, think-cell round cannot integrate the components into one interconnected problem. Instead, the components of the formula will be taken as distinct problems which will be solved independently. The results will then be used as input to other formulas. In many cases, the output from think-cell round will still be reasonable. There are cases, however, where the use of operators other than +, -, SUM and AVERAGE leads to rounded results which are far off from the result of the non-rounded calculation. Consider the following example:    In this case, the precise calculation for cell C1 would be 8.7×1.7=14.79. Since cell A1 and cell B1 are connected by a multiplication, think-cell round cannot integrate the formulas from these cells into a common problem. Instead, after detecting cell A1 as valid input, cell B1 is evaluated independently and the output is taken as a constant within the remaining problem. Since there are no further constraints, value 1.7 from cell B1 is rounded to the nearest integer, which is 2. At this point, the “precise” calculation for cell C1 is 8.7×2=17.4. This is the problem that think-cell round now tries to solve. There is a consistent solution which requires rounding up 17.4 to 18. The result looks like this:    Note that the rounded value in cell C1, which is 18, greatly differs from the original value 14.79.23.2.3 Troubleshooting TCROUND formulas There are two possible error results you may come across when using think-cell round: #VALUE! and #NUM!. The #VALUE! error hints to syntactical problems, such as mistyped formulas or bad parameters. Also, pay attention to use correct delimiters: For example, while in the English version of Excel the formula looks like this: =TCROUND(1.7, 0), in a localized German version of Excel it must be written as =TCROUND(1,7; 0). Another mistake specific to think-cell round is the placement of the TCROUND function call: You cannot use a TCROUND function within another formula. Please make sure that TCROUND is the outermost function of the cell’s formula. (see Placement of TCROUND functions) The #NUM! error results from numerical problems. When the output of a TCROUND function is #NUM!, this means that the problem as stated by the given set of formulas is mathematically unsolvable. (see 23.2.2 Limitations of think-cell round) As long as the formulas enclosed by TCROUND functions contain merely +, - and SUM, and all TCROUND statements share the same precision (second parameter), a solution is guaranteed to exist and will be found by think-cell round. However, in the following cases there is no guarantee that a consistently rounded solution exists:  Formulas involve other operations like multiplication or numerical functions. Also, summations where the same addend appears more than once are mathematically equivalent to a multiplication.  You use different precisions in the second parameter of the TCROUND function.  You make frequent use of the specific functions  TCROUNDDOWN, TCROUNDUP and TCROUNDNEAR.  You can try to restate the problem to get a consistent solution. Try the following:  Use a finer precision for some or all TCROUND statements.  Do not use TCROUND with multiplication or numerical functions other than +, - and SUM.  Use the same precision (second parameter) for all  TCROUND statements.  Use TCROUND instead of the more specific functions TCROUNDDOWN, TCROUNDUP and TCROUNDNEAR wherever possible. 23.3 Calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR)The think-cell TCCAGR formula simplifies the calculation of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Use this function to quickly analyze business data over time. For more information on the CAGR, see Wikipedia.23.3.1 Use the TCCAGR formula In Excel, enter your data in a range of cells in a single row or column. In another cell, type\\xa0=TCCAGR(FIRST_CELL:LAST_CELL). Replace FIRST_CELL with the first cell in your range, and LAST_CELL with the last cell. Alternatively, to calculate the CAGR directly from the Excel ribbon, select the data range in a row, then select think-cell > Formulas > Insert CAGR     . Currently, the Insert CAGR     button only functions with a row of cells.                                          Note: The TCCAGR formula uses only the first and last cells in the range—the cells between the two do not affect the calculation. Furthermore, the formula requires positive values in both the first and last cells to return a meaningful result.23.3.2 Represent a year in multiple cells The TCCAGR formula has an optional second parameter to represent a year\\'s data across multiple cells. To use this parameter, after the range, add the number of cells that represent a year. If you don\\'t use this optional parameter, the TCCAGR formula takes each cell to represent one year by default.For example: =TCCAGR(B1:B5)\\xa0calculates the CAGR over a four-year period, with each cell representing one year. Using the optional parameter, =TCCAGR(B1:B9, 2) calculates the CAGR over a two-year period, with every two cells in the range representing one year.Note: Comma is used as the delimiter in most versions of Excel. In some localized versions, however, comma is the decimal separator, so the semicolon is used instead of the comma for parameters. Make sure to use the correct delimiter for your Excel version.23.3.3 Troubleshoot the TCCAGR There are three possible error results you may come across when using the TCCAGR formula:\\xa0#VALUE!, #DIV/0!, and #NUM!.The\\xa0#VALUE!\\xa0error may result from mistyped formulas or bad parameters. Make sure to use the correct punctuation for localized versions. For example, in the English versions of Excel, the formula looks like this: =TCCAGR(A1:A10, 2), but in the German version of Excel, the comma is replaced with a semicolon: =TCCAGR(A1:A10; 2).The TCCAGR formula works in a range of cells arranged in a single row or column. Using the formula with cells that are not in a single row or column will result in a\\xa0#VALUE!\\xa0error. Another reason for a\\xa0#VALUE!\\xa0error is having a negative value in either the first or the last cell in the range. The TCCAGR formula requires positive numbers in both cells to function.If the value of the first cell in the range is zero, the formula will return a #DIV/0! error, as the CAGR calculation would involve division by zero.If both the first and the last cell in the range are zero, the formula will return a #NUM! error, as the TCCAGR requires both cells to have positive numbers.23.4 Applying Excel table styles as regular formatting Excel\\'s Format as Table feature allows you to quickly transform a selected range of cells into a formatted table. However, this formatting is applied independently of regular cell formatting, and is therefore, for example, not recognized by VBA macros. Moreover, applying it is somewhat cumbersome, requiring at least three clicks. think-cell allows you to define up to ten favorites and apply them to the selected range as regular cell formatting with a single click in the Ribbon. To do so, first define the style you would like to apply:  Go to Home>Styles>Format as Table and either: Create a completely new style by selecting New Table Style. Base your style on an existing one by right-clicking it and selecting Duplicate. Name the style \"think-cell Table Style n\" where n is a number from 1 to 10. Define the table formatting as usual and click OK.  Now you can add a button to the Ribbon that applies this table style as follows (see also C.6 Customize the think-cell ribbon):  Right-click the Ribbon and select Customize the Ribbon.  Select the tab you want to place the button on on the right, or create a new one by clicking New Tab.  Create a new group in the tab by clicking New Group, or select an existing custom group.  On the left, go to Main Tabs>think-cell Commands>think-cell Commands.  Select think-cell Table Style n, where n is the number you picked in step 2.  Click Add >>.    Repeat as needed for further table styles. The buttons placed in the Ribbon will show you a preview of the style that will be applied. You can also use the Rename button in the Ribbon customization dialog to give the buttons more descriptive names. Note: The table style will always be applied with all header and total rows, first and last columns, and row banding defined. If you want a button for applying the table style without them, simply duplicate the style, change its name to a different n, and remove them. Column banding is not supported. You can also place buttons for quick access to cell styles in the same way. Name them \"think-cell style n\" and place the corresponding think-cell Style button in the Ribbon. Note: Custom table and cell styles are saved in the workbook, rather than globally in Excel. If you want to always use the same table styles assigned to the same buttons, create a workbook where those styles are assigned to the Ribbon buttons as described above, and save it as an Excel Template (*.xltx) that you use as a basis for future workbooks.

Discover your library and new tools. 17. Tables        Resources     Manual    Tables   Using the table element you can insert a table that will be automatically resized and positioned on your slide. You can link a think-cell table to an existing Excel worksheet, either by creating a think-cell table in Power Point directly from the think-cell ribbon in Excel or by connecting an existing table to an Excel range. In both cases, the table will appear in the Data Links dialog together with all linked charts. See 22.4 Creating a table from Excel for more information.Contents17.1 Inserting a table To insert and place a table on your slide, choose     \\xa0Table from the Elements menu. All tables in think-cell are data-driven, so they have the same internal datasheet as think-cell charts. It is openend automatically after you insert a table:    To open the datasheet again later, double-click any table cell.    Whenever you change or add data, your think-cell table will reflect this. You do not need to manually add additional columns or rows.    In the same way, you can simply delete cells, rows or columns from the datasheet to remove them from the table.17.2 Setting the size and position of a table Your table will be resized automatically based on its contents and placed on the slide automatically based on other think-cell elements on the slide (unless its edges are fixed to a position as indicated by red lines with closed locks). A table is made up of think-cell text boxes. In addition to changing the table's datasheet, you can also insert, delete, duplicate and move cells and whole columns and rows as described in 15. Text boxes. To override the automatically determined size and position of the table, you can resize the table by holding down the Ctrl key and dragging and fix its position by using the locks (see 15.8 Setting a fixed size or locked position of elements).17.3 Formatting a table You format a table like any other think-cell element by changing the font and font colors and setting a table cell background fill (see 3.4 Format and style elements). To format a whole column or row, use multi-selection with the lasso or the Shift and Ctrl keys (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). The alternate row colors feature is especially useful for tables. To set alternate row colors:  Select all rows that should alternate between colors.  Choose Horizontal Stripes from the alternate colors control.    The think-cell toolbar now includes two fill color controls instead of one. Use them to set the colors the rows should alternate between.    Alternatively, you can let the formatting of a table cell be controlled by that of the corresponding datasheet cell, by setting Use Datasheet...  Bold/Italic Font Color Fill Horizontal/Vertical Alignment  using the corresponding control in the floating toolbar. To also have the borders between cells styled exactly as they are in Excel, simply select any cell in the table and activate Use Datasheet Border in the floating toolbar. Note: The option to Use Datasheet Border is always activated or deactivated for the whole table at once. These options are particularly useful when creating a table from an already formatted Excel sheet, as explained in 22.4 Creating a table from Excel.  You can also style any cell in a table as a Rounded Rectangle, by selecting it and clicking Rounded Rectangle in the cell content control.17.4 Adding Harvey balls, checkboxes and images Instead of text, table cells can also contain Harvey balls and checkboxes, as well as images, whose state is dynamically controlled by the internal datasheet or a linked range in an Excel sheet. To have a cell display any of these items, simply select it from its content control in the floating toolbar. Depending on the item chosen, the linked Excel cell must contain the following:   Harvey Ball A number between 0 and the maximum number of segments selected (by default 4), indicating how many filled segments should be shown.   Checkboxv, o or 1 for a box with a check mark; x or 2 for a box with a cross; Space or 0 for an unchecked box    Picture from Online Service A valid internet address at which the image can be found, for example obtained by right-clicking an image on the web in your browser and selecting Copy image link/address.Note: When the data value in the linked cell cannot appropriately be represented by the selected content, for example when entering text as data for a cell containing a Harvey ball, or entering an invalid link for an image, a red exclamation mark     will be displayed next to the cell, with a tooltip specifying the problem. Harvey balls and checkboxes can be formatted as explained in 20. Checkboxes and Harvey balls. Images can be cropped as explained in 18.3.3 Crop images. There is also an additional control in the floating toolbar, allowing you to select whether the linked image is to be used as an Image (Variable Size), in which case it will always fill the whole cell, or as an Icon (Fixed Size), in which case it will have a fixed height given in pt, and will be placed in the middle of the cell if the cell is larger than the space the image needs at that size.    The height fixed in points makes it easy to align with text in surrounding cells. You can change this fixed size by changing the font size of the cell via Home > Font > Font Size or by dragging the small diagonal double arrow placed on the icon.                                    17.5 Rounded rectangle To insert a rounded rectangle, select think-cell > Elements > Rounded Rectangle      or Insert > think-cell > Rounded Rectangle     . To add text inside a rounded rectangle, select the element and start typing.To change the appearance of a rounded rectangle, select the element and open the mini toolbar. You can change the fill color, outline color, and outline style controls. To learn more, see 3.4 Format and style elements.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Introduction to layout        Resources     Manual    Introduction to layout   When creating a Power Point presentation, you frequently have to create slides like this one:    With Power Point alone, all your options entail unsatisfactory compromises or a lot of manual work: you may use an inflexible Power Point table, build up the slide with text boxes and face tedious manual adjustments after text changes, or you may use a template from Power Point’s Smart Art or your own custom library and soon bump into the template’s limitations. Using think-cell, you can quickly build up complex slides like the one above from simple text boxes (see 15. Text boxes), pentagons and chevrons (see 16. Process flows). When adding text and other elements, the slide layout is continuously re-arranged and optimized automatically. Meaningful actions like snapping together, duplicating, aligning and moving elements define a smart grid so that you never need to place or resize shapes manually. For a rectangular, structured layout of text boxes you can use our table tool. The automatic layout adjusts positions and sizes depending on the table content and allows for very quick creation. In addition, the table can be edited in a datasheet or linked to an Excel file, just like for charts (see 17. Tables). You can also include elements other than text in the automatic layout, like images (see 18. Images and icons). An agenda is usually also built from carefully aligned text boxes whose position and content should remain synchronized. Chapter 19. Agendas shows you how think-cell helps you with this. A number of additional productivity tools make several tasks more efficient when working with presentations (see 21. think-cell Tools).14.1 Lock Positions by Default Automatic layout can be unfamiliar at first, in particular because the position and size of shapes on the slide is largely determined by think-cell, and may change when inserting new shapes or editing content. This is why the    Lock Positions by Default option is enabled by default. This option makes think-cell layout elements behave a lot like native Power Point shapes: They have a fixed position and size on the slide, which you can set by clicking (and dragging) when the shape is selected for insertion. Moreover, you can simply drag and drop the shape to a new position on the slide, keeping its size, and use the handles on the corners and sides to drag them into a new position, changing the fixed size and position of the shape. This is achieved by locking all four edges of the shape into position, which is why you will see four red lines with closed locks surrounding the shape when selecting it. See 15.8.2 Locking elements to a position for more detail.    All additional features of the elements discussed in the next chapters that are not related to automatic slide layout work the same regardless of whether this option is enabled or not.Because it makes automatic layout features more easily accessible, the explanations in the following chapters assume that    Lock Positions by Default has been disabled via the    Tools menu.Introduction   1.

Discover your library and new tools. 6. Text labels        Resources     Manual    Text labels   think-cell takes care of correct and readable labeling. Avoid using Power Point text boxes to label your charts as they will be ignored by think-cell’s automatic label placement. When you create labels from think-cell’s context menu, the default content is taken from the datasheet or calculated by the program (in the case of column totals, averages, and the like). In addition, you can always enter additional text or replace the default text inside think-cell’s automatic labels. When a label is selected, you can start typing, overwriting the current text. If you want to keep the existing text, enter text editing mode by pressing F2 and use the cursor keys and Home/End keys to navigate within the label text. This section explains how think-cell’s labels work in detail.Contents6.1 Types of labels Here is a list of labels that are supported for different types of charts, and the buttons in the context menu to add or remove them:Label type Chart types Menu buttons Category Column, line, area     Series Column, line, area       Segment Column   Point Line, area, scatter       Total Column, area     Inside Pie   Outside Pie   Activity Gantt       Item Gantt   Scale Gantt   Percent indicator100%    Note: Column includes stacked chart, clustered chart, 100% chart, Mekko chart, waterfall chart, and their rotated variations. Scatter includes bubble chart.    Additionally, some chart decorations also support labels:Label type Chart decoration Menu button Tick Value axis   Title Axis   Value Value line   6.2 Automatic label placement When using think-cell, labels are automatically placed at their appropriate positions. A number of built-in rules ensures that labels are always placed for easy readability and pleasant aesthetics. These rules are specific to the chart type and to the type of the label in question. Here are some examples. For segment labels in column charts:  If there is enough space, place all labels centered.  If a label is larger than the segment it belongs to, put a colored rectangle underneath the label.  If two labels are too close together, offset one to the left and the other to the right.  If there is not enough space inside a segment, place the label outside the segment and add a line that points to the related segment.  For inside labels in pie charts:  If there is enough space, place them as close to the segment’s outside border as possible.  If a label is larger than the segment it belongs to, put a colored rectangle underneath the label.  If two labels are too close together, offset one of them towards the center of the pie. 6.3 Manual label placement In general, think-cell automatically places all labels at appropriate positions. If a label can be placed at multiple positions, you can manually change think-cell’s placement decision:  Select the label. If a drag icon appears at the lower right corner of the selection then this indicates that there are alternative locations for the label.  Drag the selection frame or the drag icon with the mouse. While you are dragging, available locations highlight, and the blue selection frame jumps to these locations.  Drop the label at the desired location.    Labels that do not show the drag icon when selected, do not offer alternative locations. When manually placing a series label, alternative locations for the label will include any existing legend (8.3 Legend) for the chart.    Once you have manually placed a label at a specific position, think-cell will respect your decision and maintain the label’s position even when the chart layout changes. If you want a manually placed segment label to be put back into automatic mode, drag the mouse pointer onto the target Drag here for Automatic or click the     \\xa0Enable Automatic Placement button from the label’s context menu.    Note: You can also drag multiple labels at the same time. To do so, use multi-selection (3.3.3 Select multiple objects) and move one of the selected labels as a representative.6.3.1 Label rotation Many labels can be rotated by 90 degrees to the right or to the left. To rotate a label, select it and choose the desired rotation from the context toolbar.    Labels that do not show the rotation button in their context toolbar cannot be rotated. Note: You can also rotate multiple labels at the same time. To do so, use multi-selection (3.3.3 Select multiple objects) and rotate one of the selected labels as a representative.6.4 Text fields You can add arbitrary text to all labels that are created with think-cell. The numbers in the labels are updated whenever the datasheet changes, even when the label contains extra text. This is particularly convenient for annotations or footnote marks. To use this function, simply type into the text box as usual. When you move the cursor or select text, you will notice that the numbers from the datasheet behave like a single character. This concept is called a text field. You can either overwrite the text field or add text before or after it, but you cannot change it. Any numbers that are based on the datasheet and are displayed in chart labels, are created as text fields. Each text field refers to a certain number created from the Excel data. This could be a single cell in the datasheet or a calculation involving multiple cells. Whenever the data source of the text field is changed, the numbers in the label are updated to reflect the change. As long as you do not delete or overwrite a label’s text field, the numbers in the text box are kept consistent with the numbers in the datasheet. You may, however, choose to delete the field and replace it with some other text or numbers. In this case, the text in the label will no longer be updated. It is not obvious when a numeric text field has been overwritten with some other number. To inform you that the label is no longer automatically updated, an exclamation mark     pops up next to the label. The exclamation mark also pops up next to category or series labels if you entered text in the datasheet but then replaced the text field with custom text. Note that the exclamation mark is purely informative and that overwriting text fields is often perfectly legitimate.    To reset a label and (re-)insert text fields, use the label content control (6.5.5 Label content) or simply click on the exclamation mark, if there is one. Note: Alt+Enter can be used to add line breaks to text in the datasheet while F7 can be used to spell-check datasheet text.6.5 Text label property controls6.5.1 Font The font control applies to all text labels. Click on a font to change the setting of the selected features. When you change the font for the element, all text that is later created within the same element adopts the new font.6.5.2 Font color  The font color control applies to all text labels. Select a color to apply to the selected labels. Please note that think-cell usually selects an appropriate font color automatically to maximize contrast to the labels background. When the font color is selected explicitly, the label may become hard to read when in front of a background with a similar color. To let think-cell control the font color again, remove the label and add it back in.6.5.3 Number format  The number format control applies to text fields that display chart data. To use the number format control, enter an example number with the desired format. The actual number you enter is not important, it is only the number format that matters. The dropdown box provides quick access to the most common formats. Also, up to four of your most recently used custom formats are available in the dropdown box. Absolute and relative values can have different formats. You can use the following punctuation characters for the grouping of thousands: comma, point, single prime and space. For the decimal point, you can use: point, comma and Arabic decimal separator. However, you cannot use the same character for the grouping of thousands and the decimal point. For example:  Type 1.000,00 to display numbers with a comma for the decimal point, with two decimal places, and thousands separated by points.  Type 1000 to display integer numbers with no grouping.  You can add arbitrary prefixes and suffixes, with or without spacing: $1.2M  If you want all numbers to be signed, select a positive number and enter a leading or trailing plus: +1,234  Type -USD 1,234 to place the algebraic sign in front of the currency, type EUR -1.234 to place it in front of the value.  With a negative number selected, remove the minus sign and enclose everything including prefix and suffix in brackets, e.g. (1,2M) to display bracketed negative values. If only a prefix or suffix is enclosed then the brackets are taken as literal characters, e.g. 1,234 (metric tons). Type –1,234 with a leading en dash to replace all minuses with en dashes.  think-cell can also use a number format that has been set in Excel. To use this, first choose the desired number format in Excel using the Format Cells... dialog and then select Use Excel Format from the bottom of think-cell’s number format control. In the context of currency, some people use single prime as a symbol for million and double prime as a symbol for billion. If you want to use this convention with think-cell, start with entering millions into the datasheet or use the magnitude control to show the values in units of millions (see 6.5.4 Magnitude). Then, enter the appropriate format string into the number format control. If you do not use the single prime in the format string, the numbers followed by a double prime always represent billions—even if there are no more numbers following the double prime. Consider the number 3842.23 (or the number 3842230000 combined with a magnitude setting of ×106).Number format control Output1\"234\\'0003”842’2301\"234\\'03”842’21\"003”841\"4”6.5.4 Magnitude  Values from data sources often have magnitudes that are not appropriate for data presentation. In think-cell, you can solve this problem by altering the magnitude of the labels without changing the data source. Here is a simple example: Your Excel table is filled with seven-digit values (e.g. 3,600,000.00) but you would prefer to show values in units of millions. Simply select ×106 from the floating toolbar and the labels will show the appropriately scaled values.6.5.5 Label content  Most labels have a label content control. Use the control to choose text fields with which to fill the label. For example, the segment labels in the column chart can show absolute values and/or percentages. (For details about filling in the datasheet refer to 5.2 Absolute and relative values.) Some labels only have one entry in this dropdown box. You can use it to restore the label’s text field if it was deleted.6.6 Pasting text into multiple labels With think-cell, creating data driven charts is quick and easy, but you still have to type the text. If you already have it available in some table or text file, think-cell can help you there, too. The text may be in a file in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word or in any other kind of text file. In Excel, labels are naturally separated into table cells. In plain text files, labels should be organized in columns (separated by line breaks) or in rows (separated by tab characters). Pasting multi-selections is not only possible with chart labels but can also be used with any native Power Point shape.  In your source file, select the text for all the labels or shapes and copy them to the clipboard (Ctrl+C or Edit > Copy).     Switch to Power Point. If the objects that are going to receive the text are not yet there, create them now. These objects can be native Power Point shapes as well as think-cell labels.     Multi-select the shapes or labels that you want to fill with text. For more tips on multi-selection, refer to 3.3.3 Select multiple objects.  Paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl+V or Edit > Paste).     If the text from the source is properly separated by line breaks and/or tab characters, each of the selected shapes or labels in Power Point receives the corresponding text from the clipboard.Introduction   1.

Discover your library and new tools. 8. Chart decorations        Resources     Manual    Chart decorations  Contents8.1 Scales and axes8.1.1 Value axis In menu:Chart Menu item:      Use this feature to show a numerical scale for the values in your chart, represented either by an axis line with tick marks or by gridlines. Usually the Y-axis in a chart is a value axis. Note: The X-axis of a Mekko chart is also a value axis. Similarly, scatter and bubble charts have two value axes that are always displayed. In addition, the X-axis of a line chart may be a value axis, rather than a category axis (see 7.4 Line chart). The X-axes of all other charts are standard category axes. When selected, a value axis has three handles, shown below both for the axis line and the gridlines representation. When using gridlines, select one of the gridlines to show the axis handles.    Value axes are usually scaled by think-cell. You can, however, manually scale a value axis by dragging the handles at the end of the value axis. The values on the axis must always include the range between the lowest and largest value in the datasheet. If you do not want to show a specific value, either remove it from the datasheet or hide the respective datasheet row or column. Automatic value axis scaling can be restored by dragging the handles until the tooltip indicates Automatic or selecting    Reset to Automatic Scale from the contextual menu of the axis or scaled chart element. Holding down Alt while dragging ensures that the value axis scale will not revert to automatic mode.  The tick mark spacing for value axes is usually calculated by think-cell. You can, however, manually adjust the tick mark spacing by dragging the middle handle. As you drag, the handle will jump to supported tick mark spacings, with a tooltip indicating the selected spacing. Releasing the handle will apply the indicated tick mark spacing to the axis. Automatic tick mark spacing can be restored by reducing the tick mark spacing until the tooltip indicates Automatic.  The     \\xa0Set Same Scale button can be used to apply the same scale to multiple charts. See 8.1.4 Same scale for further details.  The position of segments, lines and areas along an axis can be determined either based on their absolute values or, alternatively, based on their relative (percentage) portion of the whole category. Respectively, you can choose between Absolute and % from the axis type dropdown in the axis’ contextual toolbar.    In a stacked chart, switching to a percentage axis will convert the chart to a 100% chart. A clustered chart will be converted to a stacked chart, because only then the relative portions are added up to a stack representing 100% of a category. Similarly, choosing a percentage axis in a line chart will convert to an area chart. Scatter, bubble and line charts support reversing the axis direction by choosing Values in descending order from the axis direction dropdown in the axis’ contextual toolbar. In a line chart with two axes, you can set one to a reversed order to highlight negative correlations. Column, clustered and area charts flip the chart when reversing the axis.    A value Y-axis can be moved by selecting and dragging the axis with the mouse. While dragging, available alternative locations for the axis will be highlighted. Dragging to the desired location and releasing will move the axis. You will notice, when selecting and dragging the value Y-axis of a line chart, that two locations on either side of the chart are highlighted. Dragging to either of the locations will position the Y-axis on the appropriate side of the chart.    The location selected, however, also sets the crossing behavior for the chart. Two distinct styles of crossing behavior are supported for line charts:  Crosses At Categories The Y-axis crosses the X-axis at the center of a category. In this case the data points of the first category are placed directly on the Y-axis.  Crosses Between Categories The Y-axis crosses the X-axis between two categories. Consequently, the data points are offset from the border of the chart.  Regardless of the crossing behavior of the axis, the x-position of data points always corresponds to the center of the category. Selecting either of the innermost highlighted locations will set the behavior to Crosses At Categories, while selecting either of the outermost highlighted locations will set the behavior to Crosses Between Categories. The     and     buttons in the value axis context menu can also be used to alter the crossing behavior. Tick labels are usually shown to left of the axis line or gridlines. To move them to the right, select one of the tick labels and drag it to the alternative position:    Value axes have their own context menu. It shows the following buttons:    \\xa0Add Title Add an axis title. You can drag the title to choose its placement. A title can also be added to the baseline of a chart, even though it may not be a value axis.                                     \\xa0Add Tick Labels Add tick labels.                                     \\xa0Add Tick Marks Add tick marks.                                     \\xa0Add Gridlines Add gridlines.                                     Add Axis Line Add axis line. Only in the context menu of gridlines.                                       \\xa0Set Logarithmic/Linear Scale Set the axis to a logarithmic or linear scale (see 8.1.5 Logarithmic Scale).                                       Set Same Scale/Reset to Independent Scale Set the selected axes to the same scale or independent scales (see 8.1.4 Same scale).                                     \\xa0Fit Scale To Data Revert the scale and tick mark spacing to automatic sizing if they have been modified by the user.                                           Add Break Add a break at the current mouse pointer position (see 8.1.2 Value axis break).                                       \\xa0Set Crosses At/Between Categories Alter the crossing behavior for a line chart.                                  When appropriate, the buttons function as toggles for their respective function, i.e., if tick marks are already present, the same button position is used to remove them, as they cannot be added a second time.8.1.2 Value axis break In menu:Segment, axis, line, area Menu item:          Use a value axis break to shrink a particularly large segment and enhance readability for the smaller segments. To add a value axis break, click the part of the segment or axis where you want the break to go and open the context menu. When adding a value axis break, the exact position where you right-click a segment or axis makes a difference. Any break you insert applies to the value axis (if shown) and to all segments sharing the same range of the axis. For this reason, you can not add a break to the axis at any position where there is a segment border in any of the chart’s columns. A break can only be added if at the mouse pointer location there is some part of the value axis big enough to display at least the two lines that visualize the break. The break also applies to the axes and segments of any chart set to use the same scale (see 8.1.4 Same scale). This is illustrated by the following example. No break can be added to the very top part of the second column, because the top of the third column is too close. However, within the range of the third column’s segment, there is enough space for the break. Since both columns share this range of the value axis, both segments are broken:      You can adjust the size of a broken segment by dragging the lines that appear when you select the break. These lines mark the range of the scale that is compressed to save space. Drag the lines to determine the size of the compressed part of the scale. If you drag a line far enough for the compressed range of the scale to take as much space as was originally required, the break disappears. The default is to compress the selected part of the scale as much as possible while leaving enough room for the break lines to be rendered. There are two types of break shapes supported by think-cell. The straight break as illustrated above is commonly used for standard column charts. The wiggle break as illustrated below is convenient to save space in charts with wide or adjacent columns. If enough space is available, you can toggle between the two shapes with     \\xa0Set Wiggle/Straight Shape in the break’s context menu. Note: In line, area and Mekko charts only the wiggle style is supported.   8.1.3 Date axis If the datasheet contains strictly increasing year numbers, the number format of the axis labels can be changed to one of the date formats, e.g., yy for two-digit years, yyyy for four-digit years and additional formats containing days and months (see 6.5.3 Number format and 13.8 Date format codes). When the labels are formatted as dates, or when Excel’s cell format is set to Date for all category cells, you are using a date axis. When adjusting the scale of a date axis, years, months and weeks can be used for tick mark spacing.  When using a date axis, the floating toolbar of the axis displays an additional Week Starts On dropdown menu that allows you to select which weekday represents the start of a new week. When a tick mark spacing with a unit of weeks is chosen, either automatically or manually, think-cell will place dates with that weekday on the tick marks. You can mix two- and four-digit year numbers on a date axis. For example, you might display the first and last category with four-digit years and all categories in between with two-digit years. To choose the number of digits, you click the label you want to change and adjust the format. think-cell will automatically adjust other labels to ensure a consistent display. For example, if you only select the first label and use the two-digit date format yy, all labels switch to two digits as it is unusual to use two digits for the first label only. However, if you select one of the labels in the middle and use two digits, the first label will remain with four digits, but all other labels between the first and the last label will be switched to two digits:   8.1.4 Same scale When there are multiple similar charts on the same slide, it is often desirable that all of them share the same scale. Only when two charts share the same scale, are the physical sizes of their segments comparable. The following example shows two charts which have the same size, but not the same scale. Note that the column that represents 7 units in the waterfall chart is the same height as the column that represents 47 units in the column chart.   To make segments from different charts visually comparable, select segments from those charts together by holding Ctrl and clicking them, for example (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). Then, open the think-cell context menu and click the    Set Same Scale button to resize smaller scales to match the largest one.    In the above example the resulting charts look like this:    When the data represented by a chart changes, it is possible that this chart rescales. The scales of all other charts set to the same scale are then adjusted as well, including when axis breaks are added or resized. Instead of selecting multiple segments, you can also select multiple axes, gridlines or data points, one in each chart that should use the same scale. Afterwards, open the think-cell context menu and click the     \\xa0Set Same Scale button. You can also mix and match, i.e., for a line and a column chart, you would select a data point in the line chart and a segment in the column chart.To revert to independent scaling, select a segment, axis, gridline or data point and choose    Reset to Independent Scale from the contextual menu. If you are not sure which charts share the same scales, the easiest way is to revert the same scale for all charts, then to select appropriate parts in the requested charts and to activate same scale.In charts with two value axes, e.g., line or scatter charts, a second     Set Same Scale  button is available for the X-axis. Each axis can be set to the same scale independently of the other. For example, you can set two line charts to the same scale on the X-axis to make sure they cover the same date range, while their Y-axis fits the data of each chart.   8.1.5 Logarithmic Scale You can switch to a logarithmic scale by using the     \\xa0Set Logarithmic Scale button from the value axis context menu. To revert to a linear scale choose     \\xa0 Set Linear Scale . Note: An axis with a logarithmic scale can only have tick marks at powers of 10, e.g. at 0.1, 1, 10. The axis must also begin and end at a power of 10. Logarithmic scaling is not supported when it is mathematically not appropriate. Negative values are placed on the baseline and an exclamation mark     is shown next to the label explaining that the value cannot be represented on a logarithmic scale. Also, an axis always uses a linear scale if multiple series that are added up to a total are associated with the axis.8.1.6 Secondary Axis Charts that can contain lines may have an additional, secondary Y-axis. You can add a secondary Y-axis, and associate a line with this axis, by highlighting a line and selecting the    Set to Right/Left Axis button from the line context menu. If a chart has two Y-axes, then you can use the same      Set to Right/Left Axis button to alter the Y-axis association of individual lines in the chart. Alternatively, you can select    Add Second Y Axis from the context menu of the chart. A secondary axis is a fully-fledged value axis (8.1.1 Value axis) and may be scaled independently.   8.1.7 Category gap The basic spacing between columns in a chart is determined by the column width and the chart size. Extra spacing between individual pairs of columns may be added by inserting a category gap. Category gaps can be introduced by clicking on the baseline and dragging the handle to the right. A category gap is as wide as one column width plus one gap width and the handle snaps to multiples of this category gap width.    Introducing category gaps preserves the width of the columns, resulting in an increase or decrease of the overall chart width. You can ensure that the overall chart width is preserved by holding down the Ctrl key while dragging: the column widths will be increased or decreased to accommodate the category gap. Note: In some cases, a break in the baseline (see 8.1.8 Category axis break) may be a space-saving alternative to a category gap.8.1.8 Category axis break In menu:Category axis column gap Menu item:    A category axis break indicates a break in the continuity of the category axis scale. To insert the break, right-click on the category axis between two columns and select the respective menu item.   8.2 Arrows and values8.2.1 Difference arrows In menu: Chart, segment in column and waterfall charts, point in line and area charts Menu items:          Difference arrows can be used in charts to visualize the difference between pairs of columns, segments or points. The difference is automatically calculated and updated whenever the underlying data changes. The text label for the difference (see 6. Text labels) supports font, number format and label content properties (see 6.5.1 Font, 6.5.3 Number format, 6.5.5 Label content). Two distinct styles of difference arrows are supported by think-cell: level difference arrows and total difference arrows. Level difference arrows are designed to show differences between pairs of segments or points in a chart; total difference arrows are designed to show differences between column totals. Level difference arrows can be added by selecting the     or     button in the context menu. You can use the handles that appear when the difference arrow is selected to set the two values that are to be compared. The ends of the difference arrow can be attached to column segments, data points or to a value line, if there is one (see 8.2.4 Value line).      By default, a newly inserted difference arrow stretches from the selected segment or category to the top segment of the next category. You can also determine the desired start and end segment/category for the difference arrow immediately by selecting the start segment and the end segment at the same time. Then right-click on one of them and select     \\xa0Add Level Difference Arrow. To select multiple segments at a time, hold down Ctrl key while selecting (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). In case of a line or area chart, select the corresponding data points instead of segments. If the arrow is so small that the bubble would cover it up, the bubble is automatically placed next to the arrow. To manually optimize the layout, you can drag the arrow itself as well as its label to other locations (6.2 Automatic label placement). If you want to place the arrow between two columns, you might want to create an additional gap between the columns (8.1.7 Category gap).    Total difference arrows can be added by selecting the     or     button in the context menu and connecting the ends of the difference arrow to the categories or columns that are to be compared.    You can cycle through three arrow modes. The button in the context menu changes accordingly and the number in the label is recalculated:   Show an arrow pointing in one direction and calculate the relative difference.   Show a double-ended arrow and calculate the absolute difference.    Show an arrow pointing in the other direction and calculate the relative difference.8.2.2 CAGR arrow In menus:Chart, segment Menu item:    This feature visualizes the compound annual growth rate. The range of dates on which the calculation is based is taken from the datasheet cells that are associated with category labels. The CAGR is automatically calculated and updated whenever the underlying data changes. For the calculation to work correctly, it is important that the respective datasheet cells contain the correct dates. The CAGR from category A to B is calculated as    with n being the number of years in the date range. The 30/360 day count convention is followed to determine n when it is not a whole number. The automatic display of the CAGR is based on a text label (6. Text labels) and supports font and number format properties (6.5.1 Font, 6.5.3 Number format). The arrow itself supports the color property (3.4.1 Color and fill).    By default, only one CAGR is inserted that stretches from the selected category to the last category in the chart. You can use the handles that show up when the CAGR arrow is selected to specify its start and end categories. You can also determine the desired start and end categories for the CAGR immediately: Select a segment in the start category and a segment in the end category. Then right-click on one of them and click     \\xa0 Add Compound Growth Arrow . If you select segments in more than two categories, you will get a CAGR for each pair of successive selected categories. To select multiple segments at a time, hold down Ctrl key while selecting (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). In case of a line or area chart, select the corresponding data points instead of segments.   8.2.3 Series CAGR The CAGR arrow is always calculated based on the column totals. However, you might also like to visualize the compound annual growth rate of one of the series.  This can be shown in series labels. Simply select the label and choose the CAGR option from the label content control on the floating toolbar. Now the CAGR is calculated series-wise.    To select all series labels in one action, click the first label, then Shift-click the last one (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects).8.2.4 Value line In menu:Chart Menu item:    This feature displays a line parallel to the X-axis to visualize a certain value. You can create multiple value lines per chart, and you can choose to have the line’s label placed to the left or to the right of the chart. Where appropriate, the value line is initialized with and snaps to the arithmetic mean (stacked chart, clustered chart) or the weighted mean (Mekko chart) of the column totals. If the line is snapped to such a value, this value is calculated and automatically updated when data changes. You can drag the line as desired. If you need to increase the precision of the dragging operation, use Power Point controls to zoom in on the slide. You can also use the cursor keys ← → ↑ ↓ to nudge the line to a specific value. When using the cursor keys, the line moves in increments corresponding to the label’s number format. As always, you can add custom text to the label or replace the predefined label with your own content. You can learn more about labels and text fields in 6. Text labels. You can also change the label’s font (see 6.5.1 Font) and number format (see 6.5.3 Number format).   8.2.5 100% indicator In menu:Chart Menu item:    This feature shows a “100%” mark. It is on by default. You can choose to have the label placed to the left or to the right of the chart.   8.2.6 Series connectors In menus:Chart, segment Menu item:    You can add series connector lines to an entire chart or to a single segment. If you click the connector item of a segment’s menu, a connector line is created at the top right corner of that segment. If you want a connector as part of a waterfall calculation, you must use the specific waterfall connector (see 9. Waterfall chart). Alternatively, universal connectors (see 8.2.7 Universal connectors) can be used when the desired connections cannot be achieved using standard connectors.   8.2.7 Universal connectors Icon in think-cell group:    Universal connectors are different from the other decorations described in this chapter, because they do not belong to a specific element or feature. Therefore, they are not available in the think-cell context menu. Instead, you can insert universal connectors from the think-cell toolbar. Double-click the toolbar button to insert multiple connectors. To leave insertion mode, click the button again or press the Esc key. Each chart element can offer connectable points. The universal connector can connect any two connectable points that may or may not belong to the same element. Use the universal connector if you need an unusual connector that is not supported by the chart itself.    You can also use the universal connector to connect two different charts. The handles at the ends of the connector snap to connectable points while you move them. The handle in the middle of the connector can be dragged to change the straight connector to one with a right angle.    Note: The universal connector visually connects two objects, but it has no effect on the calculation of the waterfall chart. If you want a connector as part of a waterfall calculation, you must use the specific waterfall connector (see 9. Waterfall chart). Standard connectors (see 8.2.6 Series connectors) are also available for a number of chart types and should be used in preference to universal connectors when possible.8.3 Legend In menu:Chart Menu item:    A legend can be used to clearly identify the various data series or groups in a chart. A floating toolbar containing a line style and a font control (6.5 Text label property controls) appears when the legend is selected, letting you specify a line style for the legend box and the size of the legend text. A control for the visual order of the placeholders can be used to specify a different order than in the datasheet or the chart itself. In addition, chart-specific property controls for the series and groups are available when selecting one of the placeholders.    If you change the size of the legend’s frame the legend text will be automatically reformatted to fit the new frame size. To create a horizontal legend, for example, pull the left or right border of the frame outwards.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3. Basic concepts   Charting   4.

Discover your library and new tools. 27. Automation with JSON data        Resources     Manual    Automation with JSON data  Automatically create think-cell presentations with Java Script Object Notation (JSON). With the think-cell JSON automation, you can do the following: Fill Power Point templates (e.g., slide titles, charts) with data Reuse and reorder templates to create new presentations Use JSON data and Power Point templates from local or remote sources Turn real-time data into new presentations with a web service 27.1 JSON file structure This section explains how to structure a JSON file for automation with think-cell. Snippets from an example file, sample.ppttc, accompany this explanation. See the complete example at the end of this section (27.1.4 Complete JSON example).In the think-cell installation folder, the ppttc folder contains the following files: The JSON schema ppttc-schema.json The Power Point template template.pptx The JSON data file sample.ppttc The file ppttc-schema.json describes the rules that a .ppttc file must follow to create a Power Point presentation with think-cell.The file template.pptx contains named charts and text fields (see 25. Introduction to automation). A template can have any number of slides.The file sample.ppttc specifies: The Power Point templates think-cell will use to create a new presentation The order in which the templates will appear The JSON data that fills the templates 27.1.1 Specify templates, elements, and their data The example sample.ppttc shows an array that represents a Power Point presentation (see 27.1.4 Complete JSON example).The array contains a series of objects, each of which represent a copy of a Power Point template. In the new presentation, templates appear in the order that you specify in the array. If a template has multiple slides, you can only modify the slide order by editing the template in Power Point.In the array, each template object must have two properties: template and data.The template property is a string that specifies the Power Point template you want to use. The string can be a relative or absolute path in the local file system or a URL (see 27.3 Provide JSON data remotely). If using a file path, the path separator must be a backslash (\\\\) on Windows—escaped to a double backslash (\\\\\\\\) in JSON—or a slash (/) on mac OS. In the simplest case, the template string is just the file name of the Power Point template stored in the same folder as the .ppttc file, as in this example.The data property is an array of objects that specify the following: Named charts and text fields The data that fills these charts and text fields The objects can appear in any order in the data array, regardless of the position of their corresponding think-cell elements in the Power Point template.Each object in the data array has two properties: name specifies a text field\\'s or a chart\\'s Update Chart name. table specifies the data that fills the element. If two elements have the same name, think-cell fills them with the same data.The table value is an array. The structure of the array depends on the element type: For a text field, the table array contains a single sub-array with a single object. The object—usually a string of text—fills the text field. For a chart, the table array contains sub-arrays that represent the chart\\'s datasheet. 27.1.2 Datasheet structure Each sub-array in the table array represents a row of a chart\\'s datasheet. For a chart’s specific datasheet layout, refer to its chapter in the user manual or open the chart’s datasheet for reference (see 4.3 Entering chart data). The structure of a default chart\\'s rows, as specified in the JSON schema, is described below.The first row is a sub-array containing category labels. An empty first cell (null) precedes the category labels. The data in the first cell does not appear in the chart, so can actually contain any data.Subsequent rows are sub-arrays containing the series labels and the chart\\'s data points. The order of the elements in a sub-array corresponds to the order of the cells in a datasheet row. The first cell in the row contains the series label, which is usually a string. Subsequent cells in the row should contain numbers or, for Gantt charts, dates.To specify an empty row, use an empty array ([]).In the earlier snippet, the empty array changes how think-cell applies the Power Point Theme color scheme to the chart\\'s series (see 3.4.2 Color scheme). The color scheme assigns dark green to the series in row 3. By leaving row 3 blank, the series Competitor 1 and Our brand are now in rows 4 and 5, to which the color scheme assigns light blue and dark blue, respectively.In the chart datasheets of your Power Point template, you can add or remove optional rows and columns (see 5.5 Edit data layout). Doing so affects how think-cell interprets JSON data in the corresponding rows and columns.For example, a default chart datasheet includes the 100%= row. Including this row means that think-cell interprets the second row of JSON data as the totals from which percentages are calculated. If you remove the 100%= row, as in this example, think-cell interprets the JSON data in the second row as ordinary data points.The following table summarizes optional rows and columns, their default datasheet position, and their default setting.Option Contents Default datasheet position Default setting Series Labels Series labels Column 1Selected Category Category labels Row 1Selected100%=Totals for percentage calculations Row 2Selected Named Text Fields—such as slide, chart, and axis titles—don\\'t have datasheets. When filling text fields with JSON data, think-cell expects a table array with one cell. Within the table array, the cell is represented as a single sub-array that contains a single object.27.1.3 Cell data types In a .ppttc file, cells can contain the following data types.Data type Key Example Notes Textstring{\"string\": \"Our brand\"}All printable Unicode (UTF-8) characters are supported.Numbernumber{\"number\": 12.5}Decimal separator must be a point (.).Calendar datedate{\"date\": \"2024-01-01\"}Required format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" (ISO 8601)Percentagepercentage{\"percentage\": 50.5}Decimal separator must be a point (.). Do not include the percent sign (%).Datasheet cell fill colorfill Hex: {\"number\": 12, \"fill\": \"#ff0000\"}RGB: {\"number\": 12, \"fill\": \"rgb(255,0,0)\"}Add fill and a hex or RBG value to another key.To apply datasheet fill colors to chart features, in the Power Point template, select Use Datasheet Fill (see 3.4.2 Color scheme).Empty cell Not applicablenull Do not enclose null in braces or quotation marks.27.1.4 Complete JSON example See the complete JSON example from sample.ppttc below:27.2 Create presentations with JSON data When think-cell is installed, it tells your operating system to open .ppttc files with think-cell. To open JSON files with think-cell in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (mac OS)—for example, by double-clicking—use the .ppttc extension.When a JSON file is opened, think-cell does the following: think-cell reads the file and checks it for errors. think-cell creates a new presentation. The presentation consists of copies of the slide templates specified in the top-level array in the JSON file. In the template copies, think-cell fills the charts and text fields (identified by name) with their corresponding data (specified in table). The elements update accordingly. The new presentation opens in Power Point. You can save or further edit the presentation. Create presentations from the command line    Windows only Create a presentation from JSON data from the command line by entering the following:ppttc input.ppttc -o output.pptx The executable file ppttc.exe is located in ppttc in the think-cell installation folder. Call ppttc.exe in automation scripts to create new Power Point presentations.27.3 Provide JSON data remotely Remotely generate JSON data for a .ppttc file on a server. To create a new presentation, the user downloads the .ppttc file from a web browser and opens the file with think-cell.For an example of how to generate and download JSON data with a server, in the think-cell installation folder, see /ppttc/sample.html. The file sample.html contains the following elements: HTML markup for a button that, when clicked, compiles JSON data on the fly Some static JSON data. In a typical use case, the JSON data comes from other sources. A Java Script function that downloads the .ppttc file to the user\\'s computer After the user downloads the .ppttc file, they can save or open it. When the user opens the file, think-cell creates a new presentation using the JSON data (see 27.2 Create presentations with JSON data).27.4 Provide Power Point templates remotely To provide Power Point templates via a server, do the following: In the JSON file, provide a URL instead of a local path for the template key. The URL protocol can be HTTP or HTTPS. Ensure that the user opening the .ppttc file has access to the remote template. A standard think-cell installation on the user\\'s machine is enough to generate think-cell presentations with remote JSON data and templates.27.5 Create presentations remotely Set up automated workflows in which users download think-cell presentations with custom data. To download presentations, users just need a web browser. They don\\'t need to have think-cell installed on their computer.To set up these workflows, you need to run the think-cell server, which only operates on Windows. The think-cell server takes JSON data as input and delivers Power Point presentations as output.Run the think-cell server    Windows only To start the think-cell server, follow these steps: Open the think-cell installation folder. Run tcserver.exe. Enter a URL that specifies the IP address and port the server should listen on. The server protocol is HTTP or HTTPS. Select Register URL. When prompted, allow the think-cell server to make changes to your device. To stop the think-cell server, follow these steps: Select Unregister URL. When prompted, allow the think-cell server to make changes to your device. The Log displays the following: Confirmation that the server has started or stopped listening on a URL All client requests and server responses The server accepts JSON data as HTTP POST requests with media type (a.k.a. MIME type) application/vnd.think-cell.ppttc+json and responds with a Power Point file.To automatically start the think-cell server when you turn on your computer, follow these steps: Select the Run as auto-start service option. In Password, enter the password for the account named in the Run as auto-start service option. Try it out!    Windows only Create a Power Point presentation with the click of a button with our ready-made example. Start the think-cell server with the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a browser. The webpage \"ppttc test\" will open. Select Send .ppttc to server and get .pptx. The think-cell server creates a Power Point presentation from JSON data. The browser downloads the presentation to your computer.The HTML source code of the \"ppttc test\" page demonstrates a possible use of think-cell JSON automation. The source code can serve as a starting point for your own automated workflow. The code contains the following elements: HTML markup for a button that, when clicked, invokes a method using XML Http Request to communicate with the think-cell server. Some static JSON data. In a typical use case, the JSON data comes from other sources. A Java Script function to send the JSON data to the think-cell server. The server generates the HTTP POST request with the static JSON data. The server response is a file download. The \"ppttc test\" page uses Java Script to send HTTP POST requests and to save the think-cell server\\'s response as a Power Point file. Obviously, other languages work, too.Introduction   1.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.think-cell.com/en/resources/manual/exceldataautomation', 'image_urls': []}, page_content='think-cell Suite has arrived. Discover your library and new tools. 26. Automation with Excel data        Resources     Manual    Automation with Excel data   When data is provided in Excel, you can use the functions Update Chart and Presentation From Template to programmatically control using that data. With Update Chart you exchange the datasheet of a specific element with your Excel data. With Presentation From Template you use your data to create a new presentation based on a Power Point template with think-cell elements linked to data ranges in Excel as described in 22. Excel data links. The interface to both functions is integrated into the Office Automation model, so it can be accessed from any language with which you can program Office, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or C#. See F.1 Getting started for detailed instructions. The entry point into think-cell is the think-cell add-in object. It can be accessed via the Application.COM Add Ins collection. Calls into think-cell are always late-bound. See Microsoft’s knowledge base for an explanation:Using early binding and late binding in Automation Thus, the type of the think-cell add-in object is simply Object, and there is no type library or reference to add. Just acquire the object, and you are ready to make calls. For example, in VBA in Excel: In C#, you can achieve late binding by declaring the reference to the think-cell add-in object as dynamic; this is also the type inferred by the compiler when declaring the reference as var, so that you can simply write: Here xlapp is a reference to an Excel.Application object in which think-cell is loaded.Contents26.1 Update Chart26.1.1 Signature26.1.2 Description This function updates all elements in target with name str Name with the data contained in rg Data. For the data to be interpreted correctly for charts, the range rg Data must conform to their configured datasheet layout, or its transposed version, see also 22.1 Creating a chart from Excel and 22.2 Fitting the data layout. Whether the default or the transposed version is to be used is indicated by setting b Transposed to false or true, respectively. For elements other than charts, tables for example, the value of b Transposed is ignored. target must be a Presentation or Slide Range, or a single Slide, Master or Custom Layout . The name str Name is matched case-insensitively. It must have been previously assigned in Power Point using the Update Chart Name property control as described in 25. Introduction to automation. To ensure that the correct elements are targeted, make sure that they are the only ones with their Update Chart Name set to str Name in the object passed as pres. If a targeted element is linked to an Excel data range when invoking this function, the link is broken. Afterwards, the element will not be linked to any Excel range.26.1.3 Examples To use these samples, prepare a presentation as described in 25. Introduction to automation, and save it as C:\\\\Samples\\\\Update Chart\\\\template.pptx. To use this sample add it to a module in an Excel workbook. It requires a reference to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details). Running Update Chart_Sample in a workbook will update the chart in the presentation template with the data contained in range A1:D5 of its first sheet. To use this sample, replace the code in Program.cs of the C# Console App project template with it. It requires references to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library, the Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library and the Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.2 C# for details). Running the resulting application will update the chart in the presentation template to contain a single series named \"Series 1\" with values 1, 2, 3, and save the result as template_updated.pptx.26.2 Presentation From Template26.2.1 Signature26.2.2 Description This function uses the data links between the Excel workbook wb and the template with filename str Template to instantiate that template by updating the linked elements with the data from the ranges they are linked to. The result is a new presentation within the Power Point instance ppapp. str Template can either be a full path or a relative path, which is then taken to be relative to the location of the Excel workbook file wb. All elements in str Template that are linked to the Excel workbook wb are updated (regardless whether they are set to auto-update or not). In the resulting presentation, their data links are broken to prevent further changes to these elements. Elements in str Template which are linked to Excel workbooks other than wb are left unchanged and still linked, so it is possible to update links from multiple Excel workbooks by saving the result of this function as a new template and then calling this function again with the next workbook. If you want to control the colors of chart segments or the formatting of table cells with the Excel link, you can set the color scheme to Use Datasheet Fill on Top (see 3.4.2 Color scheme) or the Use Datasheet... options (see 17.3 Formatting a table), respectively. Likewise, to control the number format with the Excel link, set it to Use Excel Format (see 6.5.3 Number format). Make sure to set the relevant formatting options and the number format of the respective cells in Excel before calling Presentation From Template.26.2.3 Examples To use these samples, first create a presentation containing a stacked chart linked to the range G1:K4 of the first sheet in an Excel workbook as explained in 22.1 Creating a chart from Excel. Save the resulting presentation as C:\\\\Samples\\\\Presentation From Template\\\\template.pptx and the workbook as data.xlsx in the same directory. To use this sample, add it to a module in the Excel workbook data.xlsx prepared as explained above. It requires a reference to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.1 Visual Basic for Applications for details). Running Presentation From Template_Sample will change the value in cell Sheet1!H3, which is linked to the first value of the first series of the chart contained in template.pptx, from i=1 to 10, create a new presentation with the chart in the template updated to contain that value, and which is not linked to the workbook anymore, and save it as output_i.pptx in the same directory as the template. To use this sample replace the code in Program.cs of the C# Console App project template with it. It requires references to the Microsoft Power Point 16.0 Object Library, the Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library and the Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library (see F.1.2 C# for details). Running the resulting application will visibly open Excel, load the workbook data.xlsx, change the value in cell H3, which is linked to the first value of the first series of the chart contained in template.pptx, from i=1 to 10, create a new presentation with the chart in the template updated to contain that value, and which is not linked to the workbook anymore, and save it as output_i.pptx in the same directory as the template.Introduction   1.

Discover your library and new tools. 18. Images and icons        Resources     Manual    Images and icons  Enhance your presentations with think-cell images and icons. Images and icons work smoothly alongside other think-cell elements like charts, tables, and text boxes. To learn more about using think-cell elements, see 3. Basic concepts.There are many ways to add images and icons to your presentation. In the library, you can find personal and shared image assets, icons from Freepik, and stock images from Pexels and Unsplash. You can also use images from webpages and Power Point images as think-cell elements in your presentation.18.1 Images and icons in the think-cell Library The think-cell Library is a centralized collection of digital content, including images and icons. Search the library to quickly find the perfect visual for your presentation.In the library, these image and icon sources are free to use with think-cell: Stock images from Pexels and Unsplash Icons from Freepik Image assets from your folders, network drives, or One Drive If you have a subscription to Brandfolder, Canto, or Getty Images, you can use these sources in the library as well.To add or remove sources in the library, see 28.3.3 Add assets from your computer, network, or One Drive to the library. If some of these sources don't appear in the library, your organization may have its own library settings.18.1.1 Insert images and icons from the library into presentations To insert an image or icon from the library into a presentation, follow these steps: Open the library: in the Power Point ribbon, go to the Insert tab, then the Slides ribbon group. Select Library    .                                      In the think-cell Library, select an image or icon source. Enter a search term. Click the thumbnail of the image or icon you want to insert in your presentation. If you don't want to insert the image or icon on your current slide, select the slide you want. On the slide, click where you want to insert the image or icon. For more information, see Filter and sort images and icons and Edit folder contents.18.2 Insert images from webpages into presentations Quickly insert any image from a webpage into Power Point with the think-cell browser extension (see 2.2.4 Installing the browser extension).⚠Caution: Most images on the internet are protected by copyright. If you use a copyrighted image in your presentation, make sure you have permission to do so.  Open the webpage that contains the image you want to insert into Power Point. Select the think-cell extension. If you frequently use the think-cell browser extension, you can pin it to your browser's toolbar for convenience.  Click the image you want to insert. Power Point will open.  If you don't want to insert the image or icon on the current slide, select the slide you want. On the slide, click where you want to insert the image. 18.3 Format images: Position, resize, and crop This section explains how to position, resize, and crop an element in image mode. To use image mode, click the element to open the mini toolbar and select Image (Variable Size).To format an element in icon mode, see 18.4 Format icons: Position, resize, and crop.The following instructions describe how to format images with Lock Positions by Default    on. To take full advantage of think-cell layout, open Tools   and turn off Lock Positions by Default   . For more information, see 14. Introduction to layout.18.3.1 Position images To manually position an image, do one of the following: Drag the image. Drag the image's locks. Drag the image's white handles. If you manually position an image, its position is locked. A locked image has closed locks and red gridlines at its corners. If you add more elements to the slide, a locked image stays where it is.To automatically position an image using think-cell layout, click the locks to open them. For more information on think-cell layout, locks, and gridlines, see 14. Introduction to layout.18.3.2 Resize images To resize an image, resize the blue selection frame. Do one of the following: To resize an image manually, drag the image's locks or white handles. To resize an image automatically, open one or more locks. Click a lock to open or close it. The image automatically scales to fill the blue selection frame. If the selection frame's aspect ratio doesn't match the image's original dimensions, think-cell automatically crops the image to make it fit. think-cell doesn't distort the image to fit it into the selection frame.By default, the center of the image stays in focus when resizing. If you want a different part of the image to stay in focus, select this area with the crop region (see 18.3.3 Crop images).18.3.3 Crop images When you crop an image, the crop region defines what part of the image stays in focus. When resizing a cropped image, you can change its aspect ratio independently of the crop region's dimensions. The image scales to fill the blue selection frame while keeping the crop region as centered as possible.To crop an image, follow these steps: Select the image you want to crop. Hover over one of the black crop handles until you see a black crop cursor. If you see a white double-ended arrow cursor, move your mouse just inside the selection frame so that you see a black crop cursor.  Drag a black crop handle. To restore the original image, follow these steps: Select the cropped image. Make sure that at least one lock is open. To open a closed lock, click it. On the Picture Format tab, in the Adjust group, select Reset Picture & Size. 18.4 Format icons: Position, resize, and crop This section explains how to position, resize, and crop an element in icon mode. To use icon mode, click the element to open the mini toolbar and select Icon (Fixed Size).To format an element in image mode, see 18.3 Format images: Position, resize, and crop.The following instructions describe how to format icons with Lock Positions by Default    on. To take full advantage of think-cell layout, open Tools   and turn off Lock Positions by Default   . For more information, see 14. Introduction to layout.18.4.1 Position icons To manually position an icon, do any of the following: Drag the icon. Drag the icon's locks. Drag the icon's white handles. If an icon's blue selection frame is larger than the icon, think-cell positions the icon in the middle of the frame. To adjust the icon's position within the frame, click the icon to open its mini toolbar, and select a horizontal alignment or vertical alignment.If you manually position an icon, its position is locked. A locked icon has closed locks and red gridlines at its corners. If you add more elements to the slide, a locked icon stays where it is.To automatically position an icon using think-cell layout, click the locks to open them. For more information on think-cell layout, locks, and gridlines, see 14. Introduction to layout.18.4.2 Resize icons To resize an icon, drag the blue sizing arrow. Alternatively, in the mini toolbar, enter or select a size. An icon's size is independent of the blue selection frame.To resize an icon with the blue sizing arrow, drag the arrow to increase or decrease the size.To enter or select a specific size, click the icon to open the mini toolbar. Then do one of the following: In the text box, enter a value and unit. For example, enter 12 mm or 1/2 slide height. If you don't enter a unit, think-cell interprets the value in points (pt). In the size dropdown menu, select a size. When resizing icons, choose from the following units: Points (pt) Millimeters (mm) Centimeters (cm) Inches (in) Proportion of slide width (slide width) Proportion of slide height (slide height) 18.4.3 Crop icons To crop an icon, follow these steps: Select the icon you want to crop. Hover over one of the black crop handles until you see a black crop cursor. If you see a white double-ended arrow cursor, move your mouse just inside the selection frame so that you see a black crop cursor.  Drag a black crop handle. To restore the original icon, follow these steps: Select the cropped icon. On the Graphics Format tab, in the Size group, select Crop > Fill. 18.5 Convert Power Point images into think-cell images You can use think-cell tools, such as image and icon formatting tools, with Power Point images. To do so, convert Power Point images into think-cell images. First, select one or more images on your slide. Then in Tools    ,                                      select Convert Images to think-cell   .Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3. Basic concepts   Charting   4.

In addition to the varying segment heights of a regular stacked chart, a Mekko chart also has varying column widths. Column widths are scaled such that the total width matches the desired chart width. To preserve the visual relationship between widths of different columns, there are no gaps between columns in a Mekko chart. In fact, the baseline of a Mekko chart is a fully fledged value axis. You can select it with the mouse, and you can use its context menu to add tick marks, tick mark labels and an axis title (see 8.1.1 Value axis). If you have enabled tick marks for the baseline, you can use the floating toolbar of the axis to switch between absolute and percentage values. A Mekko chart can also be decorated with some of the features described in 8.1 Scales and axes and 8.2 Arrows and values. The labels of the Mekko chart support the label content property, which lets you choose whether you want to display absolute values, percentages, or both (6.5.5 Label content).Contents10.1 Mekko chart with %-axis Icon in Elements menu:      A Mekko chart with %-axis (sometimes also called marimekko chart or  100% cost curve) is a two-dimensional 100% chart. As in the 100% chart, the value axis is based on percentages and column heights are shown relative to 100%. In the regular 100% chart, since the columns are scaled to relative heights, there is no visual representation of absolute column totals. The Mekko chart with %-axis extends the 100% chart and uses variable column widths to represent column totals. Thus, the segment area is proportional to the absolute value of the segments. As in the 100% chart, by default the datasheet takes percentages and the 100%-equivalent values are entered explicitly in the row labeled 100%=. As an example, the above Mekko chart is rendered from the following datasheet:    Alternatively, you can also enter absolute values into the datasheet. In this case, for all columns that add up to 100%, you can leave the 100%= row empty. For details about entering relative or absolute values refer to 5.2 Absolute and relative values.10.2 Mekko chart with units Icon in Elements menu:      A Mekko chart with units (sometimes also called submarine chart or olympic chart) is a two-dimensional stacked chart. As in the regular stacked chart, the value axis and the datasheet of this chart are based on absolute values. Width and height are controlled completely independently. Column widths are entered in the X\\xa0extent row on top and individual segment heights are entered as in a regular stacked chart.   10.3 Ridge In menu:Chart Menu item:    You can highlight the outline of the Mekko chart: Click the     \\xa0Ridge button to add or remove a bold ridge.   10.4 Other Series You may want to combine several segments representing small portions of a category into one segment for “Other”. This way, an “Other” series is added to the chart, in particular when such a segment collecting smaller series is present for every category. To create an Other Series, select all the segments that should be subsumed in it, right-click to invoke the context menu and choose     \\xa0Move to Other Series. Once an Other Series is present, you can also select one of its segments and drag the handle that appears up and down to include additional segments in it or exclude segments that should be displayed individually again.    An Other Series can also be used in the stacked and 100% charts.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3. Basic concepts   Charting   4. Introduction to charting     5.

Discover your library and new tools. 12. Scatter chart and bubble chart        Resources     Manual    Scatter chart and bubble chart   Scatter charts and bubble charts are similar in many aspects, both using an xy-plot to visualize datasheet contents. The charts differ, however, in the style of markers used for the individual data points. The datasheet for a scatter chart is organized as follows, with each row representing a single data point:    The datasheet for a bubble chart contains values in the Size column, but is otherwise organized identically:    The Group column in the datasheet can be used to organize individual data points into groups. In the above scatter chart datasheet, the first three data points belong to group A while the remaining data points belong to group B. Multiple data points belonging to the same group can be easily selected by clicking on a data point and then moving the mouse pointer while holding down the Shift key (see 3.3.3 Select multiple objects). The axes of scatter charts and bubble charts can also be adjusted. Please refer to 8.1 Scales and axes for details. You may also use dates for the X or Y values. When all cells in the datasheet for one axis contain dates and Excel’s cell format is set to Date, then the tick mark labels of this axis show dates and you can format them accordingly (see 13.6 Date format control). If Use Datasheet Fill on Top is selected (see 3.4.2 Color scheme), you can set the fill color from Excel’s cell formatting in any cell in a data point’s row to set the color for this data point’s marker.Contents12.1 Labels In both chart types, up to two labels can be associated with each data point. Labels can be added using the     \\xa0Add Label button and removed using the     \\xa0Remove Labels button. The label content control lets you select the format of the text field for each label, allowing the display of the label text as well as the x, y and size values (see 6.5.5 Label content). By default, labels are disabled in charts containing more than 300 data points. If required, they can be enabled using the context menu. The automatic labeler places labels as close to their data points as possible, using connecting lines if necessary (see 6.2 Automatic label placement). While the labeler is busy calculating the label placements, a rotating progress icon     appears in the upper left corner of the chart and the concerned chart is highlighted with a light gray frame. You can save the file or continue to work on other charts or slides while the labeler is running. In rare circumstances the labeler may not find an optimal placement for all labels. When this happens, manually placing labels will help. Try to manually place one of the poorly placed labels and let the labeler automatically place the remaining labels. An acceptable placement for all labels can normally be achieved by manually placing only a few problematic labels.12.2 Scatter chart Icon in Elements menu:      The scatter chart uses the marker scheme control to consistently mark data points belonging to the same group (see 3.4.10 Marker scheme). The marker shape control can be used to set the marker shape for individual data points (see 3.4.9 Marker shape). If you choose No Markers in the marker scheme control, the markers for the data points are switched off. In this case the labels are centered on the position of the data points. However, the automatic label placement may offset the labels from this position to prevent overlap.12.3 Bubble chart Icon in Elements menu:      The bubble chart is a variant of the scatter chart, with data points marked by circles. The circle sizes are determined by the values in the Size column. By default, the Size value is proportional to the area of the circle. The     \\xa0Make Diameter Represent Size button in the context menu can be used to set the Size value to be proportional to the diameter of each circle. To enable a legend of the bubble size, click     \\xa0Add Bubble Size Legend in the chart’s context menu. To change the bubble size used in the legend, select the bubble and drag the handle that appears on the right boundary.    When you select one of the bubbles inside the chart, a similar handle appears on the right boundary. Change the bubble size by dragging it. All other bubbles are scaled accordingly, as the ratio between bubbles is always determined by the numbers in the datasheet’s Size column. When two bubbles overlap, the smaller bubble will be shown in front of the larger one. To change the order, choose     \\xa0Bring to Front from a bubble’s context menu.12.4 Trendline and partition In menu: Chart, data point Menu item:   12.4.1 Trendline In scatter or bubble charts you can let think-cell calculate a trendline for a group of values. A trendline is a graphical representation of trends in the group. They are used for the study of problems of prediction, also called regression analysis. The trendline is calculated using linear regression so that the sum over all points of the quadratic difference between the Y coordinate and the trendline value at the X coordinate is minimized. In a bubble chart, the bubble size is used to weight each point’s contribution to the difference. There are two ways to add a trendline to the chart:  Right-click a marker or a bubble of the desired group and select     \\xa0Add Trendline/Partition from the context menu.  Select a partition line (see 12.4.2 Partition). In the toolbar you can choose a group of values and the line is changed to a trendline for this group.     Trendlines are only available when both axes of the chart are set to a linear scale. You can choose the type of trendline from the trendline type control in the trendline's contextual toolbar. The Linear type is the default and always available. In the scatter chart, when the trendline is calculated based on a specific group (All groups is not set), additional trendline types are available: Power: Fits best when there is a power law relationship between Y- and X-values. Exponential: Fits best when there is an exponential relationship. Logarithmic: Fits best when there is a logarithmic relationship.  Any axis breaks will be removed when a non-linear trendline is used. The following example illustrates the good fit of a Power trendline in a scatter chart where the Y-values are squares of the X-values:    You can change the background color of an area bounded by a trendline and move the line in the same way as for a partition line (see 12.4.2 Partition). However, once you have moved the line, it will revert to being linear and will no longer be calculated from the values in the datasheet. When choosing a background fill for an area bounded by a trendline, the line will be extended beyond the X axis range of the data group it is based on to the edge of the chart.12.4.2 Partition You can add a partition line to scatter or bubble charts to point up a partition of a set. To add a partition line, select     \\xa0Add Trendline/Partition from the chart’s context menu. Partition lines are only available when both axes of the chart are set to a linear scale. You can move the line by clicking on it and dragging it to the desired position. It is also possible to select the partition line and then drag the handles at the beginning or end of the partition line. While dragging, the end points will snap to nice values. The spacing of the snap points depends on your current zoom level. If you hold down the Shift key while dragging, the angle of the partition line is constrained to the current angle or to that of a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line. To make a copy of a partition line, hold down the Ctrl key while dragging. This is an easy way to create parallel lines, e.g. to mark a range of values. You can change the background color of an area bounded by partition and trendlines by clicking that area and selecting a background color from the toolbar.    If you want to calculate the position and angle of the line based on the values in the chart, see 12.4.1 Trendline.Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. A. Deployment guide        Resources     Manual    Deployment guide  This chapter describes how to deploy think-cell in a larger organization. If you want to install a personal copy of think-cell on your computer, please refer to 2. Installation and update.A.1 Considerations before installation Most aspects of deploying think-cell are the same on both supported platforms (Windows or mac OS). If there is some variation in detail, this is mentioned directly in the text. The mechanics of the initial installation and the distribution mechanism of configuration settings differ more substantially and are described in separate sections. If you only administer think-cell on Windows, feel free to skip the installation section for mac OS, and vice versa.A.1.1 Workstation prerequisites On Windows, think-cell works with Microsoft Office 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021, or 2024 for Windows, with at least Power Point and Excel installed. think-cell also works with the fully installed versions and Click-to-Run versions of the desktop Office apps in Office 365. On Mac, think-cell works with Microsoft Office 2016 (version 16.9 or later), 2019, 2021, or 2024 for Mac, and mac OS High Sierra (10.13) or later. think-cell also works with the fully installed versions of the desktop Office apps in Office 365. The following components must be installed: Microsoft Office Excel Microsoft Office Power Point Visual Basic for Applications (from Office Shared Features)  The installation of think-cell requires less than 300Â\\xa0MB of disk space.A.1.2 Language The think-cell user interface is available in English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. During the installation, think-cell uses the language corresponding to the regional settings of the operating system. After installation, think-cell uses the same language as in the menus and dialogs of the installation of Microsoft Office. All supported languages are included in the same, unified installation package. If a language is not yet supported by think-cell, English is used. It is not possible to alter the automatic language selection behaviour.A.1.3 Automatic updates think-cell tightly integrates with Power Point and Excel to offer its streamlined user interface and wealth of functionality. Due to the tight integration, it is not possible to guarantee compatibility with unknown future changes to Microsoft Office. Therefore:  Major version updates, i.e., switching from Power Point 2013 to 2016 or from 2016 to a future version, will always require the most recent think-cell version.  For Click-to-Run editions of Office, which includes Office 365, most updates will require a think-cell update (also see A.1.4 Differences between Office 365 channels).  Security updates for MSI-based editions of Microsoft Office on Windows will usually not require a think-cell update. However, this cannot be guaranteed and occasionally a security update for Microsoft Office will require a think-cell update for compatibility.  think-cell has built-in automatic update support. In this way, we ensure compatibility with any Microsoft update and provide new features. When Power Point or Excel are started, the software checks for a new version. If there is one, the software attempts to install the update. If available, think-cell uses the Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download updates on Windows. BITS automatically frees bandwidth when the user needs it, and also recovers gracefully from network interruptions common in mobile computing environments. Each update is approximately 100Â\\xa0MB in size. All files that are executed and installed by the automatic update are digitally signed by think-cell. The integrity of the update is verified against a self-signed certificate that is included in the version of think-cell currently installed. Automatic updates always keep the installation location and update think-cell in place.A.1.4 Differences between Office 365 channels For the Microsoft 365 licensing plans including Office 365, Microsoft offers various so-called update channels which deploy updates with varying frequency and delay. think-cell supports all update channels of Office 365. We check for Microsoft updates to all channels every night, and if there is an update that conflicts with think-cell, we immediately start working on a corresponding think-cell update. In the following it is assumed that think-cellâ€™s automatic updates are enabled.Here is an overview of the quality of service you can expect from think-cell when using each one of the channels:Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Default in Microsoft 365 Enterprise (Office 365 Pro Plus) for tenants created before June 9, 2020) and Monthly Enterprise Channel and Current Channel (Default in Microsoft 365 Business, Home, Personal; default in Microsoft 365 Enterprise for new tenants created on or after June 9, 2020): We initiate an automatic think-cell update before Microsoftâ€™s update, so no outage of think-cell should occur. Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview) and Current Channel (Preview): The think-cell update is available for download, but we do not always trigger a timely automatic update. When a conflict occurs and you have error reporting enabled, the update will be installed automatically. If you have error reporting disabled and support email not redirected (see Troubleshooting and critical errors), and the user selects Request Support in the error dialog, they will get an automatic email response even outside of our business hours including a link to the update download. Beta Channel We make the think-cell update available as soon as possible after the Microsoft update, but outages may occur. Once the think-cell update is ready, the distribution mechanism is the same as for Preview channels.A.2 Initial installation A.2.1 Configuration parameters think-cell can be configured in a variety of ways to fit with your particular needs and environment. Below is a table of think-cell configuration parameters available for both Windows and Mac installations. On Windows, some additional configuration options for the A.5 Configure the Power Point and Excel ribbons are available. For details on how to use a parameter with:  Windows installer on the command line, see A.2.2 Installation on Windows  Group Policies, see A.2.2.3 Group Policy  defaults on the command line on mac OS, see A.2.3 Installation on mac OS  A device management solution for mac OS such as Jamf or Intune see A.2.3.2 Managed deployment on mac OS.  Deploying or changing configuration parameters via the Windows Installer command line is only possible when (re-)installing think-cell. Parameters can be deployed and changed using one of the other three methods also for an existing installation.For details on the usage and effects of each parameter, see the sections linked in the last column of the table. For mac OS, all keys listed below have to be prefixed with com.think-cell.settings. and target the com.microsoft.office domain. For example, the full licensekey key is com.think-cell.settings.licensekey. If the key listed in the table is of the form [parent key].[subkey], e.g. reports.enabled, then the parent key is of type dict and the subkey is of the type given. For example, reports.enabled is listed as type boolean, which is the type of the enabled key contained in the value of the key of type dict whose full name is com.think-cell.settings.reports.Windows installer command line Values Group policymac OS preference key Type Values More information LICENSEKEY=\"ABCDE-...\"License Keylicensekeystring ABCDE-...A.2.4 First start UPDATES=0, =1Automatic Updatesupdates.enabledbooleanfalse, true A.3.1 Control think-cell updates manually UPDATESURL=\"https://...\"updates.urlstringhttps://...A.3.2 Host think-cell updates on your own server NOFIRSTSTART=0, =1Suppress First Start Actionsnofirststartbooleanfalse, true A.2.4 First start REPORTS=0, =1Error Reportingreports.enabledbooleanfalse, true A.3.5 Error reporting SUPPORTEMAIL=\"desk@...\"Supportsupport.emailstringdesk@...Troubleshooting and critical errors DEFAULTSTYLE Absolute path to style file or relative to TARGETDIR\\\\styles\\\\Default Style Filedefaultstylestring Absolute path to style file or relative to /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/think-cell/styles/C.3 Deploy think-cell styles STOCKIMAGESDISABLECANTO, STOCKIMAGESDISABLEGETTY, STOCKIMAGESDISABLEPEXELS, STOCKIMAGESDISABLEUNSPLASH=0, =1Stock Images: Other Providers stockimages.

Note that there is only one installer and think-cell will use 32-bit or 64-bit as needed. Use the setup_*.exe if users shall install think-cell by double-clicking the setup file. think-cell can be installed per-machine or per-user. If the installing user has admin rights or can elevate via Windows User Account Control (UAC), the default is to use the per-machine context. However, if a user is allowed to install software but does not have admin rights and cannot elevate via UAC, the per-user context is used. Based on standard behavior of the Windows Installer mechanism it is possible for different think-cell versions to be installed in parallel if they are installed in different contexts (e.g., different versions installed per-user for different user accounts, or a different version installed per-user and per-machine, respectively). If more than one installation exists, it is always the per-user installation of a given user account that is executed. Any other installations (including a per-machine installation) are ignored. This is true even if the per-user installation is an older version than a parallel per-machine installation. Use the following approaches for scripted or command prompt installations, or if you need to force certain installation options:setup_*.msi /qn TARGETDIR=\"<absolute path>\"  The executing account needs full administrator permissions, e.g., by using a script started by remote maintenance software, or by starting the installer from a command prompt which was launched with \"Run as administrator\". The installation will abort if the account has insufficient privileges.  Omit the ALLUSERS parameter.  The other parameters are optional:  The /qn parameter suppresses the Windows Installer user interface.  The default destination directory is %PROGRAMFILES%\\\\think-cell  on 32-bit Windows systems and %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\\\think-cell  on 64-bit Windows systems. If you set a different path with the TARGETDIR parameter make sure the destination is readable by all users on the machine.  If you prefer you may also use the setup_*.exe as follows: setup_*.exe ALLUSERS=1 The other parameters work the same as for the setup_*.msi. setup_*.exe /qb  Omit the ALLUSERS parameter. You will get a per-machine installation if the user account can elevate to administration permissions, otherwise the installer falls back to per-user.  The other parameters are optional:  With Windows 7, /qn may be used to completely suppress the installerâ€™s user interface. /qb displays a progress bar and /qb! removes its Cancel button. With Windows 8 and later versions only /qb is recommended as /qn may silently abort the installation or unexpectedly install per-user even though the account may elevate permissions. (This is due to Microsoftâ€™s changes to UAC in Windows 8 and depends on the accountâ€™s specific UAC settings.)  For the default destination directory of per-machine installation see above. For per-user installation the default is %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\think-cell  It is recommended not to set a different path with the TARGETDIR parameter, but if you do, make sure it has the appropriate permissions and ownership for the respective context. setup_*.exe /qn ALLUSERS=\"\"  ALLUSERS=\"\" forces a per-user installation even if the user account may elevate permissions by UAC.  Execute the installer for each user account.  The other parameters are optional:  /qn may be used to completely suppress the installerâ€™s user interface. /qb displays a progress bar and /qb! removes its Cancel button.  The default destination directory is %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\think-cell  It is recommended not to set a different path with the TARGETDIR parameter, but if you do, make sure the directory has the appropriate permissions and ownership for the current user account.  The installation directory contains the executables, libraries and other files required for think-cell. Noteworthy are the following directories and files:  admin-policy-templates (templates necessary for managing settings via Group Policy)  ppttc (schema and samples for automation using JSON)  styles (style files and additional examples for customization)  xml-schemas (schema for think-cell style files)  NOTICE.txt (obligatory notices for included components)  The think-cell installation does not write to directories other than the chosen installation directory. While using think-cell additional files are written to the following directories:C:\\\\Users\\\\[user]\\\\App Data\\\\Roaming\\\\think-cell C:\\\\Users\\\\[user]\\\\App Data\\\\Local\\\\think-cell To interact with Microsoft Power Point and Microsoft Excel, the installation of think-cell creates some new keys in the following sections of the Windows registry. Depending on whether you have a regular installation or a single-user-installation, the keys are created in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER section:\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\ >{3EAB3858-A0E0-4A3B-A405-F4D525E85265}\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\ >{D52B1FA2-1EF8-4035-9DA6-8AD0F40267A1}\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\thinkcell.addin\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\thinkcell.addin.1\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\ >Power Point\\\\Addins\\\\thinkcell.addin\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\ >Excel\\\\Addins\\\\thinkcell.addin In 64-bit versions of Windows the following additional keys are created:\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\CLSID\\\\ >{3EAB3858-A0E0-4A3B-A405-F4D525E85265}\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\CLSID\\\\ >{D52B1FA2-1EF8-4035-9DA6-8AD0F40267A1}\\\\Software\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\ >Power Point\\\\Addins\\\\thinkcell.addin\\\\Software\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\ >Excel\\\\Addins\\\\thinkcell.addin The license key and the settings for online quality assurance and automatic updates are saved in the following section of the Windows registry:Software\\\\Classes\\\\Software\\\\think-cell If group policies based on think-cell.adm/x (see A.2.2.3 Group Policy) are used in your network, think-cell may also use:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Policies\\\\ >think-cell HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Policies\\\\ >think-cell think-cell changes no other sections of the Windows registry. think-cell supports Windowsâ€™ Group Policy to centrally control think-cellâ€™s behavior for a group of users or on a group of machines. To use Group Policy, you need to create a Group Policy Object and link it to a site, domain, or organizational unit using the Group Policy Management Console. The following explanation requires an understanding and working knowledge of Group Policy concepts and administration. For general information on Windows Group Policy concepts and details of their usage and update mechanisms, refer to the contents of the online help of the Group Policy Management Console. think-cellâ€™s specific configuration options are described in the think-cell.admx administrative template file, which is located in think-cellâ€™s installation directory in the subdirectory admin-policy-templates. To make use of the new options copy think-cell.admx and en-US\\\\think-cell.adml from admin-policy-templates to %SYSTEMROOT%\\\\Policy Definitions and %SYSTEMROOT%\\\\Policy Definitions\\\\en-US respectively. A new node think-cell is added to the node Administrative Templates in the following two places: the think-cell settings configured under Computer Configuration determine registry entries at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\ >think-cell and the think-cell settings configured under User Configuration determine registry entries at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\ >think-cell If settings are enabled at both places, those under Computer Configuration take precedence. The items of the node think-cell show the available settings that can be controlled with group policies. Each item has a description with the available values for this item. You can use group policies to activate or deactivate think-cell for a group of individual users. For instance, if you deploy think-cell on a terminal server you need to make sure that only the licensed users have access to think-cell. When used in the following way, group policies offer a convenient method to do so:  Set up one group policy object which disables think-cell completely and link it to your domain. Use the Product Access Control setting of the administrative template think-cell with the appropriate value.  Add another group policy object which activates the software for the licensed users. This should also be linked to your domain and be applied after the disabling one. Because group policy objects are applied in reverse order the enabling object should be further up in the list in Group Policy Management Console.  In the section Security Filtering of the Group Policy Management Console restrict access to the enabling group policy object explicitly to the licensed users of think-cell.  Another convenient use for group policies is the centralized management and distribution of the think-cell license key to the think-cell users in your organization. The license key is controlled via the License Key policy.A.2.3 Installation on mac OS The think-cell installation file, setup_*.pkg can be used interactively or the installation can be scripted using the standard installer command. Only the domain Local System can be used as a target, i.e., think-cell is always available to all users on the machine. Administrative settings and configuration parameters are stored in the com.microsoft.office preference domain. See A.2.1 Configuration parameters for an overview of the available settings and their key and type. For example, you might want to deploy your company\\'s license key to every think-cell installation by adding a line like the following to the same script that calls installer to install the setup_*.pkg file: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office com.think-cell.settings.licensekey \"ABCDE-...\" Note: When using defaults to modify the value of a subkey of a dict-valued key, for example the value of the enabled subkey of the com.think-cell.settings.reports key, the subkey needs to be specified as part of a list of key -type value triples following -dict-add as in the following example: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office com.think-cell.settings.reports -dict-add enabled -bool true Consult the man page for defaults for further information. Note: In previous versions, think-cell\\'s configuration settings were stored in a config.plist file in think-cell\\'s installation directory. This way of deploying settings is deprecated and may be removed in a future version. If your are deploying configuration settings by writing to the config.plist file, we urge you to move these settings into the com.microsoft.office preference domain to ensure compatibility with future versions of think-cell. Refer to A.2.1 Configuration parameters for key paths and types. think-cell is installed in the following directory: /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/think-cell The following items are required for think-cell and are created in the installation directory: jamf (administrative template for configuring think-cell using Jamf Pro)  NOTICE.txt (obligatory notices for included components)  ppttc (schema and samples for automation using JSON)  styles (style files and additional examples for customization)  tcaddin.plugin (the add-in running in Power Point and Excel) xml-schemas (schema for think-cell style files)  You can also use a device management solution such as Jamf Pro or Microsoft Intune to deploy and configure think-cell.think-cell provides a JSON schema for Jamf Pro that allows you to easily configure all available configuration parameters.After installing a Mac version, you can find the schema appropriate to that version in think-cell\\'s installation directory under:/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/think-cell/jamf/think-cell.json Upload it to Jamf Pro and deploy the selected settings as described at Customizing the App Using Jamf Pro.The target domain is com.microsoft.office .Alternatively, you can manually author a .plist file directly as described in the next section A.2.3.2.2 Intune and other MD Ms. To configure think-cell you can also author a .plist file containing the relevant key-value pairs directly, which you upload to your management solution and target to the com.microsoft.office preference domain. See the documentation of Intune and Jamf for detailed instructions, for example. Here is an example of a .plist file configuring some of the available settings. For a full list see A.2.1 Configuration parameters. Note: When using Intune, you need to edit the .plist file before uploading so that it only contains the key-value-pairs, without any surrounding <?xml>, <!DOCTYPE>, <plist>, and (outermost) <dict> tags. The Intune version of the example above would thus look like this:A.2.4 First start After think-cell has been installed and the user starts Power Point for the first time, a dialog to enter the license key is shown. With the licensekey configuration parameter a license key can be specified during installation or centrally deployed beforehand (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters). Also on the first start, the ribbon is switched to the Insert tab, where the think-cell group is located. A web page with a tutorial is also opened. Both actions can be suppressed by the nofirststart configuration parameter (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters).A.2.5 Browser extension think-cell comes with a browser extension to enable its 24. Tableau data functionality, and to import 18. Images and icons from the web into Power Point. The extension is available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. The extension is automatically installed into Chrome and Edge when think-cell is installed. However, extensions installed in this way need to be enabled manually by the user (see 2.2.4 Installing the browser extension). To avoid this need for user interaction, we recommend explicitly managing the installation of the think-cell browser extension using the management policies of the supported browsers. In particular, we recommend force-installing the extension along with think-cell for think-cell users, and blocking the installation for all others, especially if think-cell is installed per-machine on a machine not all users of which have access to think-cell, like a terminal server (compare Using Group Policies to manage access on a terminal server). The following table summarizes the relevant information:Browser Chrome Edge Firefox Extension I Dppcdkdcafnbklehdngbhmhpidandcjkepmpompicahgikemojmmcobiceeejbcmb{7166074E-49FE-4BC8-9006-27A0D5F8A6B8}General instructions Set Chrome Browser policies on managed P Cs Manage Microsoft Edge extensions in the enterprise Customizing Firefox Using policies.json /Customizing Firefox Using Group Policy (Windows) /Managing Firefox with Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune) /Managing policies on mac OS desktops Force-install Extension Install Forcelist Extension Install Forcelist Extension Settings> \"installation_mode: \"force_installed\",\"install_url\": \"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/think-cell/latest.xpi\"Block Extension Install Blocklist Extension Install Blocklist Extension Settings> \"installation_mode: \"blocked\"A.3 Ongoing maintenance A.3.1 Control think-cell updates manually If you want to control think-cell updates manually, you must disable any automatic updates by Microsoft for Power Point and Excel. Deployment of Microsoftâ€™s updates must be controlled by you. If automatic Office updates by Microsoft are enabled, you cannot disable think-cell updates. think-cell will download and install updates in that case. If you disabled automatic Office updates by Microsoft or directed the Office updates to your own server, you can disable think-cellâ€™s updates via the UPDATES/updates.enabled configuration parameter (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters). In this case, think-cell does not check whether an update is available when starting Power Point and Excel. You may also contact us and request to disable automatic updates via a setting on our server. In that case, the update check still occurs, but the reply always indicates that no update is available. Note: As a result of an error, think-cell may inform the user that an update with a fix is already available and offer it on a web page (see A.3.5 Error reporting). If think-cellâ€™s automatic updates are disabled, you need to manually check think-cell compatibility with every update to Power Point and Excel. For an effective check, you need to  start Power Point,  insert a chart,  wait for the internal datasheet to open and change a number,  confirm that the change is reflected in the chart.  If any of those steps fail, you need to take action. The current version of think-cell available from our website will usually be compatible with the Microsoft update you wish to deploy. Therefore, please repeat the test with the current think-cell version and plan for a deployment before or together with the Microsoft update. Testing think-cell with every Microsoft update is not optional. It is a necessary part of your support for the think-cell users in your organization. Testing is not necessary if think-cellâ€™s automatic updates are enabled. In any case, you should regularly deploy think-cell updates so that your users can benefit from the latest improvements. We recommend an update at least every few months.A.3.2 Host think-cell updates on your own server Updates are usually hosted on think-cellâ€™s web server, but you have the option to host updates within your own intranet. To do so, you need a web server such as Apache or Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) that all think-cell users within your organization can access. The following files must be placed on the web server hosting your updates:  An XML text file, typically called update.xml, that controls the update process. See below for a description of the update XML file format.  One or more setup_think-cell_<version>.exe update files, supplied by think-cell.  After placing the necessary files on the web server, use the UPDATESURL/updates.url configuration parameter specifying the location of the update XML file (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters), e.g.https://example.com/update.xml The update XML file must contain a list of scenarios, with each scenario consisting of a set of conditions and the corresponding URL of a setup file. The first scenario whose conditions are met determines the file that the client will download and install. By applying conditions such as a list of machine or user names, different users can receive different updates. For example, new program versions can first be distributed to a small group of pilot users before they are rolled out in the whole organization. Windows: The following example shows a complex update XML file using WQL queries: Conditions within the file are written in the Windows Management Instrumentation Query Language (WQL), which gives access to all relevant system parameters. To learn more about WQL, go to:http://www.think-cell.com/wql If you want to control the update by comparing the version number, follow this example: The update conditions are met when the current build number is greater or equal (val=\"1\") to 26000 and less than (val=\"-2\") 26388.A.3.3 Notification about license key expiration think-cell requires a license key and can be used up to and on the expiration date of the license key. The software will notify the user about the upcoming expiration on every start of Power Point or Excel if the expiration date is less than 14 days away. The license key dialog is used to notify the user. If the license key has not yet expired, the message â€œThe license key of this think-cell product will expire soon. You should enter a new license key:â€� is shown together with the expiration date. The user has the following choices:  Enter a new license key and click OK.  Click Cancel to dismiss the dialog. Click Uninstall to uninstall think-cell.  If the expiration date has already passed, the message â€œThe license key of this think-cell product has expired. Please enter a new license key:â€� is shown, but clicking OK is only possible after a valid license key has been entered. If the dialog is dismissed using Cancel think-cell remains deactivated. To prevent the license expiration dialog from being shown please make sure to order and deploy a new license key more than 14 days before the expiration date. A new license key is always valid immediately and not only after the expiration date of the old license key. Therefore you should deploy the new license key as soon as it is available.A.3.4 Information sent over the internetthink-cell sends information over the internetâ€”for example, when using the automatic update or displaying a list of new features when a new version is started for the first time. This information is required so that our servers can generate an appropriate response, and to help us improve the product based on statistical data: The five-digit build number, identifying the version of the software. The build number can also be found in the About dialog. The license key A randomly generated Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Date and time Version numbers and architecture of the operating system and Microsoft Office installations CPU architecture and supported instruction sets Update level (disabled/enabled/forced) Statistical information about feature usage Privacy note: The information sent to think-cell cannot be linked to actual machines or individual users, and it does not contain any information about the documents that users create or edit.The GUID is created when someone uses think-cell for the first time on a machine. The GUID is stored with the user\\'s settings. It is a random string that helps us determine whether two requests come from the same machine (pseudonymization).While it is impossible to infer the identity of a user or machine from the GUID, the GUID is recorded in the log file. If the user shares their log file in a support case scenario, we use the GUID from the log file to identify requests from their machine.Security note: All communication with our servers is secured with state-of-the-art techniques and encryption (HTTPS).If error reports are enabled, additional information is sent as described in the next section A.3.5 Error reporting.A.3.5 Error reporting At think-cell, we are committed to stability and robustness as key factors for the professional use of our software. When an error condition arises while you are using think-cell, the software automatically generates a report that helps us to understand the problem and fix it in the next release. An updated version of think-cell that addresses the reported error may already be available at the time of the report. In this case, the update is installed automatically (see A.1.3 Automatic updates for details on the download and installation of updates). If think-cell updates are controlled manually (see A.3.1 Control think-cell updates manually), the update is offered for download in a browser window and can be manually installed. An automatically created report contains the following information:  the basic information listed in A.3.4 Information sent over the internet,  an error code from the operating system, from Power Point or Excel, or from think-cell itself,  the location in our source code (file name and line number) where the error occurred,  a Microsoft Minidump, which is basically a stack trace along with environment information such as operating system version and loaded modules. Microsoft uses the same Minidump when they send error reports,  The error report is sent via HTTPS to the think-cell server. Of all the information transmitted, only the Minidump, essentially memory content, could potentially contain actual slide content fragments. But in its operation, think-cell never stores actual slide content. Storing text or images is completely left to Power Point. Therefore it is very unlikely that the Minidump of the memory used by think-cell contains any sensitive information. Automatic error reporting can be enabled or disabled via a configuration parameter (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters). In case of critical errors the user is asked whether he or she would like to file a support request.   These support requests can also be sent manually (see 2.4 Troubleshooting). It is possible to change the default email address for support requests via a configuration parameter (see A.2.1 Configuration parameters).A.4 Configure the think-cell Library As an administrator, you can configure the think-cell Library for users in your organization as follows: Select predefined library sources and their order in the library source list. Standard users can\\'t hide, reorder, or otherwise modify these sources. Enable or disable access to library deployment settings for users with local administrator accounts. Enable or disable specific library sources. Connect a specific Brandfolder account to the library. Users won\\'t be able to connect a different account. Configure the Brandfolder, Collection, and Section menus. The think-cell Library supports the sources in the following table.Content Content location Available on Windows Available on Mac New folder Slide and image assets Local computeryesyes*Network drive(s)yesyesâ€\\xa0One Driveyesno Slide Templates Slide templates Local computeryesyes Freepik Icons Online provideryesyes Pexels Stock images Online provideryesyes Unsplash Stock images Online provideryesyes Brandfolder Requires Brandfolder subscription Image assets Online platformyesyes Canto RequiresÂ\\xa0Canto subscription and accountÂ\\xa0URLÂ\\xa0endingÂ\\xa0inÂ\\xa0canto.com Image assets Online platformyesyes Getty Images Requires Premium Access subscription Stock images Online provideryesyes* On Mac, to add a local folder as a library source, someone must first add the folder to the library on Windows, then copy the folder to the Mac. If someone adds, edits, or deletes assets in the folder, these updates do not automatically appear in the library. The library only automatically updates a folder if someone has added and updated this folder on Windows.â€\\xa0 On Mac, to add a network drive or folder inside a drive as a library source, someone must first add the drive or folder to the library on Windows. If someone adds, edits, or deletes assets in the drive or folder, the library only reflects these changes if they occur on Windows.On Windows, configure the library in group policies (see A.2.2.3 Group Policy) or during installation with command-line parameters (see A.2.2 Installation on Windows).On Mac, configure the library with the defaults command-line tool (see A.2.3 Installation on mac OS) or a device management solution (see A.2.3.2 Managed deployment on mac OS).A.4.1 Configure predefined library sources As an administrator, you can configure the think-cell Library to always display certain sources. Standard users can\\'t hide, reorder, or otherwise modify these sources. The predefined sources always appear at the top of the library source list.Even if a source is hidden or disabled (see A.4.3 Enable or disable specific library sources), users with local administrator accounts can add the source to their list of predefined sources in the library deployment settings. However, a user-created list of predefined sources only applies to the user\\'s account, unless they deploy this list to the entire organization using think-cell configuration parameters. To disable access to library deployment settings, see A.4.2 Enable or disable access to library deployment settings.For Mac users, to add a network drive or folder inside the drive as predefined sources, you must add the drive or folder to the library on Windows. To add a local folder on Mac as a predefined source, you must first add the folder to the library on Windows, then copy the folder to the Mac. If someone adds, edits, or deletes assets in a network drive or local folder, the library only reflects these changes if someone has added and updated the source on Windows. You cannot add One Drive as a predefined source for Mac users.To configure predefined library sources, follow these steps: Arrange predefined sources in the library. Deploy predefined sources. To select and order predefined library sources, follow these steps: On your computer, sign in to an account with administrative rights. In Power Point with think-cell installed, on the Insert tab, select Library. Open the library deployment settings: select Configure Library   , then select Configure Deployment Settings   . Edit the list of predefined sources. To add a source to the predefined sources list, select a source name with a plus sign (ğŸ�¡) beside it. If adding one or more New folder sources, enter an absolute path for each source. Ensure all users can access the source via this path. By default, in Label, the library folder label matches the original source\\'s name. If you want to, you can enter a new folder label. If adding Brandfolder, don\\'t add the API key in the library deployment settings. To distribute an API key to users in your organization, see A.4.4.1 Add a Brandfolder account to the library. To remove a source from the predefined sources list, select a source name with an X mark (â¨‰) beside it. To reorder the predefined sources, drag their names. To revert your edits to the predefined sources, select Revert. When you\\'re finished, select Export. A string that encodes your predefined sources is copied to your clipboard. After you generate the string that encodes your predefined sources, add the string to your configuration parameters. To do so, proceed with the following instructions for Windows or mac OS.If you don\\'t add the string, your saved changes to the predefined sources apply to your account only.To deploy predefined library sources with group policies, follow these steps: Open the group policy setting Library dialog: Predefined Library Sources. Select Enabled. In Paste here, paste the string that encodes your predefined sources. Select OK.  To remove the predefined sources configuration, in Library dialog: Predefined Library Sources, select Not Configured or Disabled. Then select OK.To deploy predefined library sources with installation command-line parameters, run the think-cell installation file with the following parameter. Replace PREDEFINED_SOURCES with the string that encodes your predefined sources.To remove the predefined sources configuration, run the think-cell installation file with the following parameter:To deploy predefined sources with the defaults tool, use the following command. Replace PREDEFINED_SOURCES with the string that encodes your predefined sources.To deploy predefined sources with a .plist file for a device management solution, use the following code. Replace PREDEFINED_SOURCES with the string that encodes your predefined sources.To remove the predefined sources configuration, remove theÂ\\xa0com.think-cell.settings.library key from theÂ\\xa0com.microsoft.officeÂ\\xa0property list.A.4.2 Enable or disable access to library deployment settings Users with local administrative rights can access library deployment settings, which allow them to create a list of predefined sources (see A.4.1 Configure predefined library sources). You can enable or disable access to library deployment settings for users with local administrative rights. Standard users can\\'t access library deployment settings.To enable or disable access to library deployment settings, use the following configuration parameters.To disable access to library deployment settings with group policies, follow these steps: Open the group policy setting Library dialog: Admin Mode. Select Disabled. Select OK. To disable access to library deployment settings with installation command-line parameters, run the think-cell installation file with the following parameter:To enable access to library deployment settings with group policies, follow these steps: Open the group policy setting Library dialog: Admin Mode.

For more information on customizing the Office ribbon, see Microsoft Learn.On Windows and Mac, you can enable or disable the think-cell tabs.    Windows only On Windows, you can configure the Power Point and Excel think-cell tabs as follows: Configure the ribbon position and UI label of the default think-cell tab using XML attributes. Customize the entire think-cell tabâ€”including the tab\\'s ribbon commands, ribbon position, and UI labelâ€”using an XML file. If you configure both of these options (position and label XML attributes and a custom tab XML file), the custom tab configuration overwrites the position and label configuration.If the user resets the think-cell tab (see 21. think-cell Tools), think-cell restores your tab configuration.To configure the position and UI label of the default think-cell tab, in the think-cell configuration parameters, specify XML attributes that encode the configuration you want.When specifying command-line parameters, enclose XML code in quotation marks (\" \") and attribute values in two sets of quotation marks (\"\" \"\"). For example, on the command line, enter the XML code insert After Mso=\"Tab Home\" as \"insert After Mso=\"\"Tab Home\"\"\".To specify the position and label of the default think-cell tab, use the configuration parameters in the following table. After specifying the configuration parameters, to update the ribbon with your changes, reset the think-cell tab (see 21. think-cell Tools).GroupÂ\\xa0policyÂ\\xa0options Command-line properties Possible attributes Description Power Point:Power PointÂ\\xa0think-cellÂ\\xa0TabÂ\\xa0> <tab Excel:ExcelÂ\\xa0think-cellÂ\\xa0Tab >Â\\xa0<tab Power Point:RIBBONPPTHINKCELLTABINSERT Excel:RIBBONXLTHINKCELLTABINSER Tinsert After Mso, insert Before Mso Inserts the think-cell tab after or before a built-in tab.insert After Q, insert Before Q Inserts the think-cell tab after or before another custom tab.

To restore the default think-cell tab, follow these steps: Run the think-cell installation file with the following parameter: In Power Point, on the Insert tab, select Tools      > Reset think-cell Tab     . To deploy a custom think-cell tab, in the think-cell configuration parameters, specify the path of an XML file that encodes the tab customization.think-cell loads your custom tab every time Power Point or Excel opens, overwriting any user changes to the tab. If you disable the think-cell tab (see A.5.1.2 Enable or disable think-cell tabs), the custom tab will not appear on the ribbon.To configure a custom think-cell tab, follow these steps: Create an XML file for a custom think-cell tab. Deploy the custom think-cell tab. To create an XML file that encodes a custom think-cell tab, follow these steps: With think-cell installed, open the app whose think-cell tab you want to customizeâ€”that is, Power Point or Excel. Right-click any empty space on the ribbon. Select Customize the Ribbon. In Customize the Ribbon, customize the tab think-cell (Custom). You can customize the tab\\'s position on the ribbon and commands on the tab. For more information, see Microsoft Learn. Close the app. In File Explorer, go to %App Data% or %Local App Data%, depending on whether Office user customizations are roaming or local, respectively. In Microsoft\\\\Office, copy the .office UI file of the application whose ribbon you editedâ€”that is, Power Point.office UI or Excel.office UI. We recommend that you rename the copied file. Save the copied file to a location that users in your organization can access whenever they open Power Point or Excel. If you write the .office UI file yourself, ensure that it meets these requirements: The file is in the standard Custom UI XML format (see Microsoft Learn). The ID for the think-cell tab is Think Cell Tab0. Once you\\'ve created an XML file that encodes a custom think-cell tab, in the think-cell configuration parameters, specify the path to the XML file.The path can be a relative path from the think-cell installation folder or an absolute path. To load the custom tab, users in your organization must have access to the XML file whenever they open Power Point or Excel.Group policies To deploy a custom think-cell tab with group policies, follow these steps: Open the think-cell tab setting for the app that you want to configureâ€”that is, Power Point think-cell Tab or Excel think-cell Tab. Select Enabled. In File path, enter the path of the .office UI file. Select OK. To restore the default think-cell tab, select Not Configured, then select OK.Installation command line To deploy a custom think-cell tab with installation command-line parameters, run the think-cell installation file with the property RIBBONPPCUSTOMTHINKCELLTAB or RIBBONXLCUSTOMTHINKCELLTAB set to the path of the .office UI file.For example, to deploy a custom think-cell tab in Power Point using an XML file customizations\\\\think-cell.office UI in the think-cell installation folder, use the following command-line parameter:To restore the default think-cell tab, run the think-cell installation file with the property set to \"\". For example, to restore the default think-cell tab in Power Point, use the following parameter:You can enable or disable the think-cell tabs in Power Point and Excel. When you disable the think-cell tab, think-cell also hides Reset think-cell Tab    (Windows) and Show think-cell tab    (mac OS) in the Tools    menu.                                 To enable or disable the think-cell tab, use the following configuration parameters.To disable the think-cell tab on Windows, follow these steps: Disable loading of the think-cell tab. Remove the think-cell tab on the ribbon. You can disable loading of the think-cell tab using group policies or installation command-line parameters.To disable loading of the think-cell tab using group policies, follow these steps: Open the think-cell tab setting for the app you want to configureâ€”that is, Power Point think-cell Tab or Excel think-cell Tab. Select Disabled. Select OK. To disable loading of the think-cell tab using installation command-line parameters, run the think-cell installation file with the appropriate parameter: To disable the Power Point think-cell tab: RIBBONPPNOTHINKCELLTAB=1 To disable the Excel think-cell tab: RIBBONXLNOTHINKCELLTAB=1 To remove the think-cell tab on the ribbon, follow these steps: Open the app whose think-cell tab you want to disableâ€”that is, Power Point or Excel.

Select Not Configured or Enabled. Select OK. To enable loading of the think-cell tab using installation command-line parameters, run the think-cell installation file with the appropriate parameter: To enable the Power Point think-cell tab: RIBBONPPNOTHINKCELLTAB=0 To enable the Excel think-cell tab: RIBBONXLNOTHINKCELLTAB=0 To reset the think-cell tab, follow these steps: Open the app whose think-cell tab you want to enableâ€”that is, Power Point or Excel. On the ribbon, go to Insert > think-cell > Tools     . Select Reset think-cell Tab    .                                                  To disable the think-cell tab on Mac, in the com.think-cell.settings.ribbonpp or com.think-cell.settings.ribbonxl dictionary, set the Boolean value of No Think Cell Tab to true.For example, to disable the think-cell tab in Power Point with the defaults tool, use the following command:To do the same with a .plist file for a device management solution, use the following code:To enable the think-cell tab, set the Boolean value of No Think Cell Tab to false.A.5.2 Show think-cell commands in a think-cell group only    Windows only In Power Point, think-cell adds commands to many ribbon tabs and groups. You can limit think-cell commands on built-in ribbon tabs to a single think-cell group on the Insert tab. This configuration parameter doesn\\'t affect the think-cell tab.To limit think-cell commands to the think-cell group with group policies, follow these steps: Open the group policy setting Power Point Ribbon. Select Enabled. Select Do Not Touch Built-In Ribbon. Select OK. To restore think-cell commands to other ribbon tabs and groups, deselect Do Not Touch Built-In Ribbon. Then select OK.To limit think-cell commands to the think-cell group with installation command-line parameters, run the think-cell installation file with the parameter RIBBONPPDONOTTOUCHBUILTINRIBBON=1.To restore think-cell commands to other ribbon tabs and groups, run the think-cell installation file with the parameter RIBBONPPDONOTTOUCHBUILTINRIBBON=0.A.5.3 Configure the think-cell group    Windows only You can specify the built-in or custom ribbon tab on which the think-cell group appears, the group\\'s position on a tab, and the group\\'s UI label.When specifying command-line parameters, enclose XML code in quotation marks (\" \") and attribute values in two sets of quotation marks (\"\" \"\"). For example, on the command line, enter the XML code id Mso=\"Tab Home\" as \"id Mso=\"\"Tab Home\"\"\".For more information on configuring the Office ribbon, see Microsoft Learn.To configure the tab element where the think-cell group appears, use the following configuration parameters.GroupÂ\\xa0policyÂ\\xa0options Command-line properties Possible attributes Description Power Point:Power PointÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<tab Excel:ExcelÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<tab Power Point:RIBBONPPTABINSERT Excel:RIBBONXLTABINSER Tid Mso Inserts the think-cell group on a built-in tab.id, id Q Inserts the think-cell group on a custom tab. id Q requires a namespace declaration (see A.5.3.3 Configure the custom UI element).insert After Mso, insert Before Mso Inserts the custom tab after or before a built-in tab.insert After Q, insert Before Q Inserts the custom tab after or before another custom tab. Requires a namespace declaration (see A.5.3.3 Configure the custom UI element).label Specifies the UI label for the custom tab.If you don\\'t specify an id, id Mso, or id Q attribute for the tab element, the think-cell group appears on the Insert tab.The parameters in this example configure the following: Insert the think-cell group on a new tab. Label the tab My New Tab. Insert the new tab after the built-in Home tab. In Power Point Ribbon, in <tab, enter id=\"Tab New\" label=\"My New Tab\" insert After Mso=\"Tab Home\".Run the think-cell installation file with the following command-line parameter:To configure the group element for the think-cell group, use the following configuration parameters.GroupÂ\\xa0policyÂ\\xa0options Command-line properties Possible attributes Description Power Point:Power PointÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<group Excel:ExcelÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<group Power Point:RIBBONPPGROUPINSERT Excel:RIBBONXLGROUPINSER Tid, id Q Specifies the identifier for the think-cell group. id Q requires a namespace declaration (see A.5.3.3 Configure the custom UI element).insert After Mso, insert Before Mso Inserts the think-cell group after or before a built-in group.insert After Q, insert Before Q Inserts the think-cell group after or before a custom group. Requires a namespace declaration (see A.5.3.3 Configure the custom UI element).label Specifies the UI label for the think-cell group If you don\\'t specify an id or id Q attribute for the group element, think-cell automatically generates a unique identifier (id) for the think-cell group. If you don\\'t specify a label attribute, the group\\'s UI label is think-cell.The parameters in this example configure the following: Insert the think-cell group on the Power Point Home tab. Insert the think-cell group after the Font group. Change the think-cell group\\'s UI label to My New Group. In Power Point Ribbon, enter the following: In <tab, enter id Mso=\"Tab Home\". In <group, enter insert After Mso=\"Group Font\" label=\"My New Group\". Run the think-cell installation file with the following command-line parameters:To use the attributes id Q, insert After Q, and insertbefore Q, you must declare an XML namespace for the custom UI element (see A.5.4 Position custom controls on the ribbon). To declare a namespace, in the group policy settings Power Point Ribbon or Excel Ribbon in the <custom UI option, or using the command-line properties RIBBONPPXMLNS or RIBBONXLXMLNS, specify the following value:Replace the following: NAMESPACE_ID: the namespace identifier, e.g., ex NAMESPACE_URI: the namespace URI, e.g., http://schemas.example.com/customribbon The parameters in this example configure the following: Declare an XML namespace with the namespace identifier ex. Specify an id Q for a custom tab labelled My New Tab. Insert My New Tab after the built-in Insert tab. Specify an id Q for the think-cell group. Insert the think-cell group after the custom group ex:Group Custom. In Power Point Ribbon, enter the following: In <custom UI, enter xmlns:ex=\"http://schemas.example.com/customribbon\". In <tab, enter id Q=\"ex:Tab New\" label=\"My New Tab\" insert After Mso=\"Tab Insert\". In <group, enter id Q=\"ex:Group Think Cell\" insert After Q=\"ex:Group Custom\". Run the think-cell installation file with the following command-line parameters:In Power Point, when you add the think-cell group to the Home tab, you may want to configure a second think-cell group. This is because the Power Point ribbon has a Home tab in the Normal view (Tab Home) and a Home tab in the Slide Master view (Tab Slide Master Home). To see the think-cell group on the Home tab in both views, configure a think-cell group on both tabs.You can also configure a second think-cell group on any tab in Power Point or Excel.To configure a second think-cell group, use the following configuration parameters.GroupÂ\\xa0policyÂ\\xa0options Command-line properties PossibleÂ\\xa0attributes Description Power Point:Power PointÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<tab Excel:ExcelÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<tab Power Point:RIBBONPPTABINSERT2Excel:RIBBONXLTABINSERT2See A.5.3.1 Configure the tab element.See A.5.3.1 Configure the tab element.Power Point:Power PointÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<group Excel:ExcelÂ\\xa0RibbonÂ\\xa0>Â\\xa0<group Power Point:RIBBONPPGROUPINSERT2Excel:RIBBONXLGROUPINSERT2See A.5.3.2 Configure the group element.See A.5.3.2 Configure the group element.A.5.4 Position custom controls on the ribbon You need qualified identifiers (id Q) to position custom controls from multiple add-ins on the ribbon. For example, to position the think-cell tab before or after a custom tab (see A.5.1.1 Configure think-cell tabs), both tabs should have an id Q.âš\\xa0Caution: The position of custom controls on the ribbon can vary. To ensure that custom controls always appear in the same position for all users, see A.5.4.1 Preserve the position of custom controls.A qualified identifier consists of an XML namespace identifier followed by a unique identifier for a custom tab, group, or other control. For example, the qualified identifier ex:Tab Custom consists of the XML namespace ex and the unique identifier Tab Custom.To use qualified identifiersâ€”for example, as described in A.5.1.1.1 Configure the position and label of the default think-cell tabâ€”you must declare an XML namespace. To declare a namespace, use the following code:Replace the following: NAMESPACE_ID: the namespace identifier, e.g., ex NAMESPACE_URI: the namespace URI, e.g., http://schemas.example.com/customribbon If multiple add-ins or templates customize the ribbon, custom controls might not aways appear in the same position. This is because Power Point might not always load add-ins in the same order. If, in the example from A.5.3.3 Configure the custom UI element, Power Point loads the think-cell add-in before the add-in that creates the group ex:Group Custom, then insert After Q=\"ex:Group Custom\" will have no effect. To ensure that custom elements from multiple add-ins always appear in the same place on the ribbon, when you position one custom element relative to another custom element, specify position attributes for both elements that refer to the other. In the example from A.5.3.3 Configure the custom UI element, in the XML code for the group ex:Group Custom, specify insert Before Q=\"ex:Group Think Cell\".Introduction   1. Search in manual     2.

arrived. Discover your library and new tools. 21. think-cell Tools        Resources     Manual    think-cell Tools  This chapter explains how to use the think-cell Tools. By default, you can find most think-cell Tools on the think-cell tab of the Power Point ribbon, which enables quick access to frequently used features.If you have a customized ribbon and want to reset the think-cell tab to its default state, select Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Reset think-cell Tab. If your installation of think-cell doesn't have the think-cell tab on the ribbon or you can't find some buttons on the think-cell tab, you can still access the think-cell Tools. For example, you can access some think-cell Tools by selecting Insert > think-cell > Tools     .21.1 Align and match sizes The align and same-size tools help you quickly arrange objects on a slide. Use the reference object for more control when you arrange objects.21.1.1 Align and distribute objects Align objects to each other or to the slide. To align objects, select the objects, then select think-cell > Layout > Align or Shape Format > Arrange > Align and select how you want to align them: Align Left, Align Center, or Align Right Align Top, Align Middle, or Align Bottom Distribute Horizontally or Distribute Vertically Note the following options when aligning or distributing objects: If you select a single object, it aligns to the slide.  If you select multiple objects, you can select an object as the reference object. The reference object has a red dot at its center. To set a reference object, hover over an object until you see a red dot, then select the object.  When you align objects to a reference object, the reference object itself will not move.  If there are no think-cell elements in your selection you can still select think-cell > Layout > Align. The alignment behavior will be the same as the built-in Power Point function. To use a reference object and the alignment behavior of think-cell, you must have a think-cell element in your selection. To learn more, see 3.3.4 Reference object and 3.5.1 Align objects.21.1.2 Match sizes of objects Set multiple objects to the same width, height, or both. To match the size of objects, follow these steps: Select two or more objects. Set a selected object as the reference object. The reference object has a red dot at its center. To set a reference object, hover over an object until you see a red dot, then select the object.  Select think-cell > Layout and select Same Width    , Same Height    , or Same Size    . Alternatively, select the objects, right-click to open the context menu, then select Same Width    or\\xa0Same Height    . The selected objects will resize to match the reference object's dimensions.                                      If there are no think-cell elements in your selection, you can still select Same Width    , Same Height    , or\\xa0Same Size    . The resizing behavior will be the same as the built-in Power Point function. To use a reference object and the context menu, you must have a think-cell element in your selection. To learn more, see 3.6 Resize objects, 3.3.3 Select multiple objects, and 3.3.4 Reference object.                                 21.2 Send and save slides Send or save a selection of slides or a whole presentation. Combine your selected slides into a new Power Point presentation and share them easily.Send slides Select think-cell > Collaboration > Send Slides      or Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Send Slides     .  To send specific slides, adjust your selection as you need while the dialog is open, then select Selected Slides. To send all slides, select Entire Presentation. To send your slides, select one of the following options: To create an email in your default email app, select Compose Email.  To copy the new presentation you want to send to your clipboard without creating an email, select Copy to Clipboard—this is particularly useful if think-cell doesn't support your email or messenger app. Save slides Select one or more slide thumbnails. Unlike with Send Slides, if you're using Windows, you need to select your slides first. Select think-cell > Collaboration > Save Slides      or Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Save Slides     . Select Save. After you save the slides, the new presentation opens for editing.Choose options When sending or saving slides, choose from the following options: Include Date and Time adds an ISO 8601 time stamp to the file name. Clean up the presentation before sending or saving. To learn more about cleaning up your presentation, see 21.3 Clean up and sanitize. Any clean up options that you select apply to the presentation that you save or send without affecting the original presentation. When sending slides, choose from additional options: Add PDF attaches a .pdf of the presentation to your email, in addition to a Power Point document. To send the presentation in .pdf format only, in the file name, change the file extension to .pdf. Zip Attachment attaches the files in a compressed .zip folder. Add think-cell Link adds a link in the email to download think-cell. If the email recipient edits the presentation with think-cell, you don't need to reimport think-cell elements when you open the edited file. To learn more, see B.2 Reimporting think-cell elements from Power Point. When saving slides, to save the presentation in .pdf format only, select Save as type > PDF on Windows or Format > PDF on Mac.Send slides with Gmail    Windows only To send slides with Gmail by default, set up think-cell Send With Gmail in your computer settings. This option is only available if think-cell has been installed with administrator rights. To learn more, see 2.2.1 Installing think-cell. Select Start > Settings⚙ > Apps > Default Apps. Click on the current default app under Email. Select think-cell Send With Gmail. Select Start > Settings⚙ > Apps > Default Apps > Mail. Click on the current default app under MAILTO. Select think-cell Send With Gmail, then Set default. 21.3 Clean up and sanitize Remove sensitive information, comments, and other unwanted content to ensure your presentation is professional and secure. To clean up your presentation, select think-cell > Quality > Clean Up    or Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Clean Up   . Choose to clean up the selected shapes, selected slide, or the entire presentation, then select from the following clean up options:Option Description Check/Uncheck All Selects or deselects all the options grouped under Remove the following objects. Alt text Removes alt text from objects. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Shape Locks Unlocks any locked objects. To learn more, see Microsoft Support.

Transitions Removes transition effects. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Comments Removes comments. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Presentation Notes Removes content from the notes sections on slides. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Invisible and Off-Slide Content Removes objects that are formatted as invisible or located outside the slide area. This option doesn't remove objects hidden behind other objects or objects that are invisible due to transparency or animation effects. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Hidden Slides Removes hidden slides. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Document Properties and Personal Information Removes metadata and personal information from the document properties. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Unused Slide Masters Removes unused slide masters, including slide masters that are set to Preserve Master. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Unused Layouts Removes unused slide layouts. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Custom XML Data Removes custom XML data. To learn more, see Microsoft Learn. Make invisible objects visible Reveals hidden objects. Note that revealed objects may still be hidden behind other objects or located outside the slide area. To learn more, see Microsoft Support. Sanitize Contents: Numbers Replaces numbers with random numbers without affecting the shape and format of objects.To make changes, select Apply. To make changes and close the dialog, select OK.⚠Caution: To remove invisible content, only use the Invisible and Off-Slide Content option of the think-cell Clean Up    dialog. Do not use similar Power Point or third-party features, as they may interfere with think-cell functionality on existing slides.21.4 Insert symbols Access all the frequently used symbols at a glance. To open the Symbols dialog, select think-cell > Text > Insert Symbol      or Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Insert Symbol     . You can leave the dialog open as you continue to edit your presentation. To insert a symbol, open the Symbols dialog, place the text cursor in the desired location, then select a symbol in the dialog.What think-cell improves: The Power Point Symbols dialog requires extensive navigation to find the symbol you want. Furthermore, you can't edit your presentation while the dialog is open.21.5 Change the proofing language Older Power Point versions To change the proofing language, select some text or an object, then select think-cell > Quality > Set Proofing Language      or Review > Language > Set Proofing Language     . Select the proofing language you want, then select from the following options: All Text: Change the proofing language of the entire presentation without closing the dialog. Text on Slide: Change the proofing language of all the text on the current slide without closing the dialog. Default: Change the default proofing language for all new slides and presentations without closing the dialog. OK: Change the proofing language for your selected text only and close the dialog.  What think-cell improves: The Power Point Set Proofing Language dialog lacks the All Text and Text on Slide buttons.Recent Power Point versions If you have a recent version of Power Point, think-cell doesn't modify the built-in Set Proofing Language dialog. To change the proofing language, select some text, an object, or a slide, then select think-cell > Quality > Set Proofing Language      or Review > Language > Set Proofing Language     . To choose where you want to make changes, select Document, Slide, or Selected Text. Select the proofing language you want, then select from the following options: Default: Change the default proofing language for all new slides and presentations without closing the dialog. OK: Apply your changes to your choice of document, slide, or selected text, and close the dialog. 21.6 Replace and resize fonts Replace fonts on a particular text, slide, or in the entire presentation. To replace fonts, select think-cell > Quality > Replace Fonts      or Home > Editing > Replace Fonts     , then select options from the following dropdown menus: Replace: Choose to replace all fonts or a specific font. with: Select the new font you want to use. Change size by: Adjust the font size of the new font you want to use. Restrict to: Choose to apply the new font to all the text or only to particular text, such as text using Asian characters. Choose to replace fonts on the selected slide or in the entire presentation. To replace fonts, select Replace. To close the dialog, select Close.What think-cell improves: The Power Point Replace Fonts dialog replaces a selected font with another in the entire presentation. You can't replace fonts on a single slide, replace multiple fonts at the same time, or adjust the font size of the new font.21.7 Switch decimal symbols Switch between a comma and a point as the decimal symbol in think-cell elements. To switch the decimal symbol, select think-cell > Quality > Decimal Symbol      or Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Switch Decimal Symbol     . Choose to switch the decimal symbol on the selected slide or in the entire presentation, then select Point (123.4) or Comma (123,4).Switch Decimal Symbol    only affects text fields that have a number format control, such as automatically generated chart labels or text linked to an Excel cell that is formatted as a number. To learn more, see 6.5.3 Number format and 22.5 Creating Text Linked to Excel.                                 21.8 Display file name or file path on slides Displaying file names or paths on your slides can help you identify projects if you have specific documentation guidelines in your organization. You can add a text box to the slide master that always displays the file name or file path on all slides. You can also add a text box to the slide layout to only display the file name or path on slides that use the slide layout. The content of the text box updates automatically when the file name or path changes, as long as you open the file in Power Point with think-cell activated. To add a text box that shows the file name or path, follow these steps:  Switch to the Slide Master view by selecting View  > Master > Slide Master. Select where you want to display the file name or path on. For example, to display the file name or path on the title slide of your presentation, select the title slide layout. To display the file name or path on every slide, select the slide master. Insert any element that can contain text, such as a text box. Enter some text and apply the text formatting you want. When you save the file, think-cell replaces the text you entered with the file name or path.  Right-click the text box and select View Alt Text, or select Shape Format > Accessibility > Alt Text. In the Alt Text dialog, enter one of the following: Alt\\xa0Text What think-cell will display on slidescasecode The file name and extension.Example: ABC123_Analysis_V1.pptx CASECODE The file name and extension in capitals.Example: ABC123_ANALYSIS_V1.PPT Xcasename The file name.Example: ABC123_Analysis_V1CASENAME The file name in capitals.Example: ABC123_ANALYSIS_V1casepath The full file path and extension.Example: C:\\\\Users\\\\jsmith\\\\EU\\\\Sor Lock Co.\\\\Analysis\\\\ABC123_Analysis_V1.pptx CASEPATH The full file path and extension in capitals.Example: C:\\\\USERS\\\\JSMITH\\\\EU\\\\SORLOCK CO.\\\\ANALYSIS\\\\ABC123_ANALYSIS_V1.PPTX When you save the file, the file name or path appears on your slides.

Waterfall chart        Resources     Manual    Waterfall chart  Contents9.1 Creating a waterfall chart Icon in Elements menu:        A waterfall chart (sometimes called bridge chart) visualizes an additive calculation with subtotals. To create a waterfall chart, simply type the calculation into the datasheet:    Positive values result in segments going upwards, negative values create segments going downwards. Subtotals—i.e. segments that go all the way down to the baseline of the chart—are easily created with an e (for “equals”). In fact, you can use e in any segment that you want to be stretched to fit the rest of the chart. All e segments are calculated by think-cell and automatically kept up-to-date when data changes. You can even begin the calculation with an e in the first column. In this case, think-cell starts from the right-most column and calculates backward to find the value for the e column. Thus, the following datasheet results in the same chart as shown above:    You may enter two or more values into a single column. If you have a column made up from more than one segment, you can enter an e for at most one of them. When both positive and negative values are used in a single column, the mathematical sum of all values will be used to continue the calculation, i.e., for two segments of values 5 and -2, the gap between the connectors on the sides of the column will be 3. At the same time, all individual segments are always displayed with the correct extent. To visualize the mathematical sum of the signed segments, the connector will use an anchor that may not correspond to the top or bottom of any individual segment:    Due to the complexity of the waterfall chart concept, only simple charts can be created by using the datasheet alone. If you notice that the chart does not build up the way you want it to, first finish typing in the data. It is easy to reconfigure the chart later with the mouse. In a basic waterfall chart, every two columns are connected by precisely one horizontal connector. When selected, these connectors show two handles.  Drag the connectors’ handles to change the way columns are connected in the waterfall.  Remove a connector with Del in order to start a new summation. Add a connector by clicking     \\xa0Add Waterfall Connector in the context menu.  Based on the initial example, in the following chart the connector between the 1st and 2nd columns has been removed:    Whenever you drag a connector, the entire chart rearranges to accommodate the change and all “equals” columns are updated. Also based on the previous example, in the following chart an equals column has been added and both ends of the highlighted connector have been moved:    If connectors are conflicting with each other, skew connectors will result. Remove some of the skew connectors to resolve the problem. For example, to create a build-up waterfall with the total on the left, enter the following data into the sheet:    The resulting chart looks as follows:    Now drag the right handle of the highlighted connector to connect the “equals” column with the top of the last segment. This is the resulting chart:    If you want to create a build-down waterfall chart, use the     toolbar icon. The default datasheet is then filled with values appropriate for a build-down waterfall. Apart from this, there is no difference between a build-up and a build-down waterfall chart in think-cell. Waterfall charts can be decorated like column charts. You can decorate axes, add arrows, change gaps, etc. (see 8.1 Scales and axes and 8.2 Arrows and values). By default, the segment labels in waterfall charts show the extent of the segment which is always a positive value. Negative values in the datasheet are represented visually by downward-going segments. However, you can select a positive number and enter a leading or trailing plus in the number format (see 6.5.3 Number format) to show a sign for both positive and negative numbers or, you can select a negative number and enter a leading or trailing minus to only show a sign for negative numbers. Note: If all segments are connected properly and the chart is still not grounded on the baseline the way you want it to, select the segment that should be grounded and force it to the baseline with the     or     buttons.9.2 “Percent of datasheet 100%=” as label content Labels for level difference arrows (see Level difference arrow) in waterfall charts additionally support the display of values as percentages of the 100%= value in the datasheet (% of datasheet 100%=). Selecting % as the label content for a level difference arrow label in a waterfall chart displays the difference between the start and end of the arrow, as a percentage of the starting point of the arrow. In contrast, selecting the % of datasheet 100%= label content displays the same difference as before, but as a percentage of the 100%= value in the datasheet corresponding to the column the arrow starts from.    The above charts illustrate the two settings for the label content. In the left diagram, the difference of 2 is compared to the starting value of 2, resulting in the display of +100%. When the 100%= value in the datasheet is left empty it is taken to be the sum of the column. Therefore, in the right diagram, the difference of 2 is compared to the column sum of 3, resulting in the display of +67%. Another application is illustrated by the following chart. For the central column the waterfall total of 5 was set as the 100%= value in the datasheet. Using the  % of datasheet 100%=  setting it is possible to show that the upper two segments correspond to 40% of this total.   Introduction   1. Search in manual     2. Installation and update     3.

Discover your library and new tools. 16. Process flows        Resources     Manual    Process flows   With think-cell, you can easily and quickly create a linear process flow which consists of pentagons, chevrons and textboxes:   Contents16.1 Creating a process flow You start creating a process flow by inserting its first pentagon. Choose    Pentagon/Chevron from the Elements menu to do so. The orange insertion outline of the pentagon appears on the slide around the mouse cursor.     Click when you want to insert the element at the position shown. It doesn’t matter where exactly you click, as the pentagon is automatically placed (when 15.8.3 Locking positions by default is disabled). The element is automatically selected after insertion and text can be entered directly into it. Let’s say this element represents \"Phase 1\" of your flow, so you simply type that into the pentagon. The size of the pentagon is automatically adapted as you type.    The quickest way to add more chevrons to your flow is to use the     \\xa0Duplicate button to the right or left of a selected element. When you click on it, the element and its text are duplicated to the corresponding side, and the duplicate is automatically aligned. Alternatively, you can also hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys and press one of the arrow keys to duplicate in that direction. A pentagon becomes a chevron if necessary.    You can also do this for a multi-selection of elements. When you are done, click into each pentagon or chevron to insert or edit the text. Holding the Alt key down and hitting the arrow keys lets you easily move from one element to another. Having set the headings for your flow with the pentagons and chevrons, let’s add a table. Multi-select the row of pentagons and chevrons with your mouse, and click the     \\xa0Duplicate button below the selection. A row of text boxes is inserted below—aligned with the elements above. Suppose you would like to have another two rows for the content of your process flow, simply click the     \\xa0Duplicate button below the selection twice, resulting in the following structure:    To further describe your flow, let’s add a preceding column of text boxes for the row categories, in this case \"what, how, and who\". Select the first column of text boxes with your mouse:    Then, click the     \\xa0Duplicate button to the left of the selection. An aligned duplicate of your first column will appear. Click into each text box of the first column and type in \"What\", \"How\", and \"Who\". You can fill in the rest of your text box table with content the same way:    The size and position of the individual text boxes and the whole flow automatically adapt to the text that you enter.16.2 Changing the process flow structure Deleting individual text boxes, entire rows, or columns is as easy as inserting them. Just select the text box or multi-select the row or column you want to delete, and hit the Del key. You can also right-click into the selection and click the red     \\xa0Delete button in the context menu. If you would like to change the sequence within your process flow afterwards, you can drag & drop a column to another position (e.g., move \"Phase 3\" between \"Phase 1\" and \"Phase 2\"):  Select the respective pentagon and textboxes with your mouse.  Click onto the blue outline of the selected elements and hold the mouse button down.  Hold down the Shift key and drag the selection exactly between the other two columns until the orange boundaries shown during the drag operation indicate a move.    Holding down the Shift key only allows horizontal dragging, which makes it easy to find the correct insertion point between two columns.  Release the mouse button. 16.3 Placing the process flow on the slide Now that you have entered all data for your flow, let’s give it its final position and size. think-cell’s elements, or an aligned group of elements, are automatically placed and sized on the slide (unless their edges are fixed to a position as indicated by red lines with closed locks). We recommend that you use automatic placement, as it will save you a lot of time and will produce a balanced slide layout. You can, however, manually determine a specific position and maximum size for your process flow if you prefer. To do so, select the entire flow. You’ll notice little lock icons at the corners of the selection. They can be used to constrain the size and position of the process flow or any other element for that matter. Let’s say you want to leave a margin on each side of the slide that your flow should not expand to:  Click on the top leftmost horizontal lock icon and hold the mouse key down.    Drag the lock to the right until you are satisfied with the left margin.  Release the mouse key. The left edge of the flow is now locked into that position.  Repeat this for the right margin by dragging the rightmost lock icon into position. There are also locks for the vertical dimensions of the flow, which can be similarly used. To restore think-cell’s automated positioning and resizing, click on the lock icon to remove a lock and repeat this for each lock. See 15.8 Setting a fixed size or locked position of elements for a more detailed explanation of how to manually adjust the size and placement of think-cell layout elements.16.4 Styling the process flow  Now that you have positioned and resized it, you can add the finishing touches to your process flow by styling it. Let’s say you want to give each pentagon and chevron a different color to represent the different phases of the project. Left-click into each pentagon and chevron and select the color you want from the fill color dropdown menu of the floating toolbar (see 3.4.1 Color and fill). You can also change the line color and line style of the pentagons. Multi-select all pentagons, left-click into the selection, open the outline color drop-down menu and change the line color, for example, to Background 1 (see 3.4.7 Outline colors). Left-click into the selection again, open the line style drop-down menu, and change the line style to 3 pt solid for a thick outline (see 3.4.6 Line style). You can also control the horizontal and vertical text alignment via the floating toolbar.  To boost the readability of your flow, you may also assign alternating background colors to rows or columns with the Striping function. Just select the textboxes you would like to fill and left-click into any of them to open the floating toolbar. Open the Striping dropdown menu and click on Vertical Stripes for alternating column shading, or Horizontal Stripes for row shading. Once you have done so, the floating toolbar lets you pick the two colors for the alternating background colors. Just click on the corresponding dropdown menu and select your preferred shade from the list. Finally, to show the column and row titles in bold, multi-select the respective column or row, left-click into the selection, open the font dropdown menu and select the bold version of your preferred font size (see 6.5.1 Font).Introduction   1.

Waterfall charts in Power Point: your step-by-step guide        Resources     Content hub    Waterfall charts in Power Point: your step-by-step guide    37 min read  — by Akash Choudhary Waterfall charts are a powerful kind of data visualization that can support decision-making by highlighting how different values drive change. Waterfall charts are used in finance, consulting, and a range of other industries, yet building them in Power Point is not always straightforward.This article will introduce you to the pros and cons of waterfall charts, describe best practices for building them, and examine when they are most effective. We’ll explain step-by-step how to create a waterfall chart in Excel or Power Point, and look at ways of building more impactful waterfall charts that go beyond Power Point’s native functionality.The guide covers the following points: Key facts about waterfall charts What is a waterfall chart? How are waterfall charts used? Advantages of waterfall charts Disadvantages of waterfall charts Best practices for waterfall charts Different options for building waterfall charts Early stages: Using Excel to build waterfall charts Step-by-step: How to build a waterfall chart in Power Point Next level: Enhancing your waterfall charts with think-cell Waterfall chart FAQ Key facts about waterfall charts Before we dive in, we’ll start with a summary of the most important points covered in this article: Waterfall charts are a kind of data visualization that uses floating columns to show how positive and negative values contribute to a final result. Waterfall charts—also known as bridge charts—are used in a range of industries, most notably finance and consulting, but also by HR and leadership teams. Waterfall charts are an effective way of telling stories and supporting decision-making because they guide the audience from left to right, and help highlight the impact of specific metrics or contributing factors. To build a waterfall chart in Power Point, you can either build it directly in the presentation or you can create it in Excel and copy it over. Both Power Point and Excel have certain limitations when building waterfall charts, and they can be relatively time-consuming to work with. Professional waterfall charts are best built with Power Point add-ins like think-cell, which allow users to quickly create industry-leading waterfall charts, including enhanced functionality like stacked columns. You can download a free 30-day trial to see how much easier building waterfall charts in Power Point can be:What is a waterfall chart?A waterfall chart (also referred to as a ‘cascade chart’, ‘bridge chart’, or ‘floating bar chart’) visualizes the positive and negative changes between a starting value and an ending value. The goal of a waterfall chart is to clearly illustrate what is driving the difference between two (or multiple) values, as well as the magnitude and composition of those drivers.The name of the chart comes from the waterfall-style appearance, which is created by the columns cascading down the chart as you look from left to right. This is most evident in a waterfall chart that has a series of negative-value columns.To create—or to read—waterfall charts, you need to understand how they are built. The two outer columns, on the far left and far right, are the starting value and the final total. Both are represented by full columns that start from the baseline, just like in a standard column chart.These totals are visually distinguished from the intermediate columns, which float above the baseline and represent changes or incremental values between these totals. The reference point for each floating column is where the previous column ended. Whether this is the top or the bottom depends on whether the previous value was positive or negative. Dashed or dotted connecting lines between the columns are typically used to aid readability.A special kind of waterfall: the bridge chart The bridge chart is essentially the same as a waterfall chart, just with added intermediate columns representing subtotals. These, like the starting value and final total, are tied to the baseline and therefore show the total value up to that point, when reading from left to right.The visual effect, particularly if more than one subtotal column is included, is to interrupt the waterfall-style cascade with arches that resemble a bridge. Hence the name ‘bridge chart’.While the introduction of subtotals does have quite a significant impact on the visual appearance of a waterfall chart and how it is read, the terms ‘bridge chart’ and ‘waterfall chart’ are often used interchangeably. As ‘waterfall chart’ is the more catch-all term, that is what we will primarily use in this article.How are waterfall charts used?Waterfall charts are most frequently used to illustrate to what extent different values, such as income and costs, contribute to a total, such as a company's profit. The values reading from left to right show how each metric has driven change (or not).While waterfall charts were brought into the mainstream by Mc Kinsey & Company—a global management consulting firm—they are now heavily used across industries. Examples of how various teams use waterfall charts include: Commercial teams: To show how performance in relevant customer segments contributes to total sales volume. Sales teams: To look at how volume drops off along the stages of a sales funnel. Finance teams: To visualize the magnitude of line items in a profit and loss (P&L) statement. HR teams. To communicate net changes in headcount across offices. Leadership teams: To shed a spotlight on which business units have contributed most to hitting company targets. All of these examples use the waterfall chart’s unique visualization to show how each driver of change contributes to a total. Another usage is as an alternative to a line chart, showing how a single metric has changed across different periods of time. For example, HR teams can use waterfall charts to show changes in headcount from quarter to quarter, resulting in the year-end total.Similarly, bridge charts that include subtotal columns can also be based on a time series. In this case, the chart could show developments over several years, with subtotals showing the headcount at the end of each 12-month period.Advantages of waterfall charts As waterfall charts are less familiar than some other chart types, it’s good to understand the motivation for using them that justifies any added complexity. A good way of looking at the advantages of waterfall charts is to consider two charts showing the same data of headcount changes over the course of a year.On the left, we have the waterfall chart, which shows how headcount fell for the first three quarters, before rebounding in Q4 to a level around 90% of the initial total. On the right, we have the exact same data in a standard column chart.Even for a simple dataset like this, the waterfall chart displays several advantages over the column chart: Series labels are less disconnected from the columns Cumulative impact of changes is visualized, indicating the running headcount at the end of each quarter Intuitive flow lets the audience read the chart from left to right without jumping back and forth or up and down Clear differentiation helps distinguish between columns showing totals and those showing change These factors—particularly the natural way the chart is read from left to right and the implicit running totals—make the waterfall chart more effective at telling the story and influencing positive business decisions. This can be even more pronounced for more complex datasets.Additional advantages of waterfall charts compared with other chart types include: Versus line charts: Waterfall charts clearly emphasize what is interesting about each data point, which is either the total amount (for full columns) or the change (floating columns). Line charts need annotations to provide the same context. Versus stacked column charts: If you have a combination of positive and negative values contributing to a whole, stacked column charts become virtually unreadable, whereas waterfall charts clearly show each value’s contribution. Versus pie charts: Waterfall charts don’t only show how individual elements contribute to a whole—which can also be effectively displayed with a pie chart—they also clearly show the initial value. Also, pie charts are unsuited to negative values. Given these benefits, you might wonder why waterfall charts aren’t more common. One reason is that creating them in Power Point or Excel can be hard to get right, which sees many people resort to an unsatisfactory column or line chart.Waterfall charts don’t have to be awkward. If you want to see how easy it is to build them with think-cell is, you can jump to the section below—or you can download a free trial and have a go yourself:Disadvantages of waterfall charts No chart is suited to every scenario and every dataset. Here are a few examples of when waterfall charts might not be the best option: Running totals going above and below zero: If your starting value is positive but the data goes negative during the flow of the chart, it will cut through the x-axis. Depending on how far below zero the values go, this may impact the readability of your chart. Change values very small compared to starting value: If your initial value is a thousand times higher than your change values, then the floating columns will become very small and difficult to parse. There are possible solutions, such as leaving out the initial column and indicating the starting value another way, but you may also want to consider an alternative chart type. Too many contributing factors: If you have a very large number of categories, then labels can become compressed or even illegible. You can rotate your waterfall chart horizontally to aid readability, but you may still find that there is simply too much information on the chart. In such cases, you could try a different visualization or you may want to restructure your data so you can better highlight the most important points. Understanding the pros and cons of different chart types is critical for telling convincing data stories. You can learn more about this topic in our blog article: Find the right visualizations for your presentation.Best practices for waterfall charts There are certain principles to be aware that will help you create great Power Point presentations. The following best practices build on these with specific recommendations for the construction of waterfall charts: Stack series that go together: You have to be a little careful with stacking because combining positive and negative values in a single column can be confusing. However, there are often good reasons to stack columns, such as showing equivalent metrics (e.g. revenue, COGS etc.) for multiple business units. Stacking these can help make the overall story clearer, without hiding the granularity of the data. Make use of subtotals: If you think about the story you want to tell with your waterfall chart, then you can view subtotals like chapters. Use subtotal columns to provide visual checkpoints and to break down the big picture into digestible components for your audience. Use data labels on columns: As the floating columns of a waterfall chart don’t start from a common baseline, it isn’t always easy to discern their size. Data labels for each column help your audience compare values across the chart. Tell your story with color: Don’t turn your waterfall chart into a rainbow, but it’s often useful to show negative and positive values with color, and to use a separate color for total columns. Calculate totals with formulas: Unlike most bar charts, the columns in a waterfall chart aren’t independent of one another. Make sure that the values in your total and any subtotal columns are linked with formulas to the category values. This will ensure that your chart stays correct if the data changes or you add a new category. Different options for building waterfall charts The most important thing when creating a waterfall chart is to use a feature that is designed for creating waterfall charts. You might be able to use invisible columns and dummy data series to make a column chart look like a waterfall chart, but it won’t be scalable and will likely be a messy, frustrating experience.The three most suitable solutions for building waterfall charts are: Excel: Working with data can be most convenient in the place where data most commonly lives Power Point: Building your chart directly within the presentation environment helps reduce friction A Power Point add-in like think-cell: Leveraging a powerful software tool increases consistency and supports best practice chart creation In the following sections, we’ll take a closer look at each of these three solutions in detail.   “think-cell has been a game-changer for us. It allowed us to quickly create Gantt charts, tables and waterfall charts, which are critical for our project updates. The tool’s intuitive interface made it easy for our team to learn and use, significantly reducing the time we spent on presentation preparation.”Mariam Lelashvili, Head of Analytics in the Products Development Unit, Bank of Georgia.Learn more about how the team at Bank of Georgia work with think-cell by reading the full success story.Early stages: how to create a waterfall chart in Excel Depending on your workflow and where your data is coming from, it may make most sense for you to create your waterfall chart directly in Excel. This will often be the case if you are still refining the concept for your chart and possibly still need to aggregate or structure your data before tackling the finer points of formatting your visualization.Create a data table In Excel, you need data before you can insert a chart. Excel should be able to parse your data if it’s ordered logically in rows or columns. One recommendation is to use an =SUM() formula for the total so that your final column always reflects any changes in the other values. Just be careful to exclude any subtotal columns from the SUM—otherwise they will contribute twice to the total.Note that Excel doesn’t natively support the creation of stacked waterfall charts, so this will only work for a single series of data.Insert the chart Select your data range, go to the\\xa0Insert\\xa0ribbon tab and open the Charts\\xa0menu, where you can find the Waterfall\\xa0chart fairly near the bottom of the suggested chart types. When you first insert the chart, it probably won’t look quite as you’re expecting, but don’t worry. We’ll fix that in the next step.Set your total columns Excel does allow for totals columns in waterfall charts, but you need to set them manually. Clicking once on your total column will select the whole data series. Clicking a second time will focus the selection on the chosen column. From here, you can select ‘Series Options’ from the right-hand sidebar and check the ‘Set as total’ box. This should tie your chosen total column to the baseline. You can repeat this for any subtotals.Format your chart With your total columns set, you should have your functional waterfall chart set up. Formatting options in Excel are available via the Chart Design and Format ribbon tabs, or by right-clicking on the chart and selecting the Format option from the context menu.Excel chart formatting is fairly limited, so the best use of the Excel chart is often as a dynamic preview to help you work with your data and make decisions like which categories to group together, which subtotals to include, and how to make the best use of color.If you are building your waterfall chart as part of an Excel dashboard or report, then you can refine it as much as you like, but a common next step is to build a chart based on your Excel in Power Point, as this is likely where the chart will ultimately be presented.Step-by-step: How to build a waterfall chart in Power Point To build a waterfall chart in Power Point, you can either start by copying in what you have prepared in Excel, or you can use Power Point’s built-in functionality to create the chart from scratch within your presentation. In this step-by-step guide, we’ll start from a blank presentation. If you’re copying your chart in from Excel, you can just skip straight to the styling and formatting section.When data comes from Excel—which it very often does—linking your spreadsheets to Power Point is standard practice. However, difficulties can often arise within teams when files are updated or moved, and presentations don’t reflect the latest data. Learn more about how we’ve addressed these issues with think-cell’s robust Excel data links.Step 1: Insert a waterfall chart in Power Point The first step is to insert your waterfall chart. In Power Point, you can do this on an empty slide even before you have any data. Navigate to the\\xa0Insert\\xa0menu. Select ‘Chart’ under the ‘Illustrations’ group. Select ‘Waterfall’ from the list of chart options and click OK. This will populate your slide with a waterfall chart template, along with an Excel spreadsheet pop-up. Step 2: Add data to your Power Point waterfall chart The default waterfall chart has some example data preloaded so that you can already see a few columns. You’ll want to replace the dummy value with your own data. You can add or edit x-axis labels and value your chart’s associated Excel window. Your chart’s Excel window can be accessed as follows: Automatically opens when you first insert your chart. Select ‘Edit Data’, accessible by right clicking on the chart or through the ‘Chart Design’ ribbon tab. Note: Like Excel, Power Point functionality does not allow for stacked waterfall charts, so adding additional columns of data will not result in changes to your chart.\\xa0If your presentation would benefit from a stacked waterfall chart, this is possible with an add-in like think-cell.If you are only creating a single-series waterfall chart, you can stick with native Power Point and click on ‘Select Data’ to change the visible data in your chart.If you’re adding or removing rows of data to your chart, you’ll need to adjust the selected data Power Point is reading from. This can be done as follows: Click on the ‘Select Data’ command accessible within the ‘Chart Design’ ribbon tab. This will open the ‘Select Data Source’ window as well as your chart’s Excel window. Adjust your ‘Chart data range’, selecting the data in your chart’s Excel window you want to show. For any values that you want to define as totals or subtotals, you can use the ‘Set as total’ checkbox in the right-hand sidebar. This will be familiar to you if you have already built a waterfall chart in Excel.Data in your chart can either be: A total or subtotal, meaning the column is connected to the horizontal x-axis. A contributing value, meaning the column is seen as a floating box. Tick or untick the ‘Set as total’ checkbox to toggle a datapoint between the two. To access this checkbox, click twice on the datapoint to open its ‘Format Data Point’ task pane. You will see the checkbox under ‘Series Options’.Style and format your waterfall chart With your data inserted, it’s time to style your waterfall chart. Styling and formatting can be applied to the entire chart or an individual chart element. Make your selection, and then use the ‘Chart Design’ and ‘Format’ ribbons, or the format task pane that appears on the right when a selection is made, to make your desired styling and formatting changes.You can format ‘Increase’, ‘Decrease’, or ‘Total’ values as a group by selecting the respective legend element and formatting as desired. This is useful if, for example, you want to make all negative values red.When formatting your waterfall chart in Power Point, it’s important to remember that your chart exists within the environment of the slide it’s on. While the chart will usually be the most prominent element on a slide, there are also titles, subtitles, banners, and possibly other shapes, text boxes, or other annotations to consider.To keep your entire presentation professional and brand-compliant, ensure that the formatting and style of your waterfall chart—most notably fonts and color palettes—is consistent with all other elements.Next level: Enhancing your waterfall charts with think-cell Creating waterfall charts in Power Point or Excel comes with certain limitations, which is why many experts make use of a Power Point add-in.

What is the difference between a bar chart and a waterfall chart? In a bar chart, all columns are totals connected to the horizontal x-axis. Bar charts are used to show a series of totals next to each other. In a waterfall chart, a mix of total columns and floating columns are used. Waterfall charts are used to clearly illustrate drivers of difference between total columns.   What is a waterfall chart used for? Waterfall charts are used to shine a spotlight on drivers of change, and the relative magnitude of these drivers. They are effective for visualizing areas of growth or decline (such as revenue or customer segments), or areas of over or underperformance (such as actuals vs targets).   How do I read a waterfall chart? A waterfall chart will typically start with a total column on the far left, followed by a series of floating columns which are read from left to right. Each floating column represents additions or deductions from the running total. On the far right of the waterfall chart, there is a second total column, which shows the cumulative effect of all the floating columns in the middle.This sequence can be repeated more than once in a single chart, for which subtotal columns are used. Annotations, features, and styling can help readers interpret the chart better.   How do I change the colors of a waterfall chart in Power Point? If using Power Point’s native charting functionality, select your Power Point waterfall chart, go to the ‘Chart Design’ tab at the top of the screen and open the ‘Change colors’ gallery. Here, you can select a color palette. You can set it up to display positive values in green and negative values in red, which is a common approach in reporting.   How do I change the legend in a Power Point waterfall chart? If you are looking to change the default labels of a native Power Point waterfall chart, this will not be possible. You can easily do this, however, if you build your waterfall chart using a Power Point add-in like think-cell.If you want to change the position of the legend in a native Power Point waterfall chart, then go to ‘Chart Design’ tab at the top of the screen and locate the ‘Add Chart Element’ button under ‘Chart Layout’ group. Here you can set the visibility of the legend along with its position: top, bottom, left, right, top right. You can also choose whether the legend should overlap the chart area or not.   Can you do a stacked waterfall chart in Power Point? Unfortunately, neither Power Point nor Excel allows for stacked waterfall charts, which is a serious limitation for many presentations. There are workarounds using column charts with invisible columns, but the most efficient, scalable way to make a stacked waterfall chart is to use a Power Point add-in built for the purpose, such as think-cell.   When should I use a waterfall chart? You should use a waterfall chart when you want to present your data as a story, highlighting the impact different metrics have had on a total. Some typical usages of waterfall charts include: Tracking how net realizable value is achieved Displaying the difference between budget and actual costs Reporting on sales earnings for different segments Visualizing a sales pipeline Showing how P&L of a company has developed over time Interpreting financial statements Presenting factors that carry the greatest risk Creating OPEX and EBITDA reports    When should you use a waterfall chart ahead of a bar chart? A waterfall chart is preferable to a bar chart if you have clear start and end values, and a number of other values that impact the final total. The waterfall chart’s floating columns help tell the story of how each value has contributed to change more effectively than bar charts where all columns are tied to the x-axis.   What’s the difference between a bridge chart and a waterfall chart? In everyday usage, there doesn’t have to be any difference between a bridge chart and a waterfall chart. Both use floating columns to show how different factors have contributed to a total. However, some people use the term ‘bridge chart’ to refer to a specific kind of waterfall chart that includes subtotals. The subtotal columns form visual arches, like a bridge across a river, rather than having a cascading flow like a traditional waterfall.   How can I create a Power Point waterfall chart on mac OS? To create a waterfall chart in Power Point on mac OS, follow these steps: Open the Excel spreadsheet that contains the data you want to turn into a waterfall chart. Select your data, then navigate to ‘Insert’, click on the waterfall chart icon, and select ‘Waterfall’. Use the Design and Format tabs to customize your chart’s appearance. To set a data point as a total, double-click on the data point to select it, then right-click and select ‘Set as Total’.

The importance of data visualization for business decision-making        Resources     Content hub    The importance of data visualization for business decision-making    18 min read  — by Amos Wong Data visualization is an important tool for businesses because it speeds up decision-making. Faster decisions mean faster results, and an MIT study found that our brains can process images we’ve seen for as few as 13 milliseconds. Decisions don’t need to be made quite that quickly, but if businesses can ingest the vital information faster, they have more time to focus on evaluating options and drawing the right conclusions.Creating a data visualization to aid the decision-making process involves more than just turning a table into a column chart. It’s important that you select the right data, choose the right type of chart, remove any distractions, and present the visualization in a way that focuses the decision-makers’ attention on what matters most. Poorly constructed charts can create confusion and lead to poor business decisions.This article has three main aims: Demonstrate the core benefits of data visualization for business Present examples of how different data visualizations can support different business scenarios Provide a five-step guide to building effective data visualizations think-cell is the leading data visualization software for Power Point. You can download a free 30-day trial and see how easy it is to create impactful charts to support your arguments and drive decision-making:The benefits of data visualization in business Good data visualization makes it easier to understand the story behind a dataset. The following chart shows how this work, using a difference arrow to highlight the most relevant datapoint and shape the narrative.Even for a simple column chart with just eight distinct datapoints, trying to describe the data without a visualization would need a few paragraphs and still not be able to communicate the insights nearly as clearly. You can expand the text below to see how extreme this can be.   Text description of data. Click to expand. The data presented showcases the performance of two products, database and cloud, across four distinct time periods: Q1-23, Q2-23, Q3-23, and Q4-23. In Q1-23, the database product recorded a value of 1.5, while the cloud product achieved a higher value of 1.6.As we move to Q2-23, the database product shows a decrease to 1.2, while the cloud product demonstrates a substantial rise to 2.3. Moving forward to Q3-23, we observe a massive improvement in the database product with a value of 3.8. However, the cloud product experiences a slight decline to 1.6.Finally, in Q4-23, the database product registers a value of 1.0, while the cloud product significantly recovers and reaches a high value of 3.3. Comparing the performance of the cloud product between Q1-23 and Q4-23, the cloud product demonstrates an impressive percentage increase of 104%.The benefits of data visualization are near-universal, with clear communication and powerful storytelling playing an important role in education, journalism, or entertainment. But in business, clarity matters more than anywhere else. In business, clarity is money. Without it, businesses see friction in their decision-making, which drives down productivity and negatively impacts revenue.Let’s look at five key benefits that show why data visualization is so important for business decision-making.Focus: identify powerful levers through data analysis Part of building a data visualization is making decisions about which data to highlight and which story you want to tell. This process helps you identify patterns, trends, and the most impactful levers that wouldn’t necessarily be visible in a table. When you emphasize what matters in your data visualization, you have a clear narrative and a direct path to an impactful decision.Transparency: communicate the rationale behind business decisions Well-constructed visualizations create an unambiguous view of the data and the argument you want to make. This helps everyone understand \\xa0the rationale behind business decisions, which strengthens buy-in across teams. The best data visualizations can be easily understood without the need for a presenter, so they can be shared in the company and serve as transparent documentation of the decision-making process.Productivity: maximize the impact of everyone’s work The better the data visualization, the more efficiently teams operate because everyone’s time is used productively. An analyst’s work is more impactful if their findings are well presented and contribute to business decisions. And an executive’s time is more productively spent if they can get the relevant facts quickly and focus on decision-making.think-cell doesn't just boost your productivity when making data visualizations. With think-cell Tools, you can automate a wide range of tedious Power Point tasks and save time on every slide you make. Try them today by downloading a free 30-day trial:Speed: make important business decisions faster Not every business decision can be made quickly. Nor should it. Analyzing multiple scenarios, balancing different interests and forecasting possible outcomes is essential for making informed decisions that will help a business succeed. Making complex decisions can take time, but there is one aspect you always streamline. By using powerful data visualizations to communicate insights, you avoid one bottleneck and speed up the overall decision-making process.Culture: take more data-driven decisions Quite simply, companies that have a culture of data visualization will base more of their decisions on data. Which means more of their decisions are likely to drive the business forward. If the story behind a dataset is unclear or it takes too long to understand, decision-makers will often act based on intuition, rather than evidence. Which means their decisions won’t always lead to the best possible outcomes for the business.Examples of data visualization for business decision-making This section looks at five examples of specific kinds of data visualization and how they can be used to drive decision-making in different business scenarios.Mekko charts for visualizing revenue share data Mekko charts, also known as Marimekko charts, make use of column width to provide information not available on column charts. This makes Mekko charts well-suited to presenting market or revenue share data, as they can show percentages on the y axis, while also showing the volume of different regions or business units. Without a Mekko chart, a decision-maker could overestimate the significance of a high percentage growth rate in a region that makes a relatively small contribution to the overall business.Pie charts for easily-consumable data visualizations Pie charts aren’t suited to every kind of dataset, but for a limited number of categories that make up a relevant total, they can’t be beaten for ease of consumption. Because they’re so recognizable, pie charts can help quickly set the scene before diving into more complex visualizations for finer analysis. Pie charts are also useful for evaluating the impact of a significant change with a before/after comparison.Column and bar charts for visualizing business reports Column charts are often used in recurring monthly reports to show the performance of different regions, channels or business units. While it’s easy to simply update the data, a small amount of formatting can turn a regular column chart into a powerful data visualization. By highlighting the most important column or adding an insightful difference arrow, updating your report becomes more than a box-ticking exercise and can contribute to meaningful business decisions.Waterfall charts for telling a story with your data visualization Waterfall charts can support business decisions by illustrating how each contributing factor impacts a final result. Waterfall charts are unfamiliar to some, and they aren’t easy to build in Power Point, but their unique ability to tell a story makes them a staple of decision-making for a range of business contexts and industries.Gantt charts for visualizing project timelines Unlike other charts that visualize business data like revenues, sales, or market shares, Gantt charts are used to display project timelines. But they’re no less important for driving business decisions. A clear timeline is a must-have for any project manager who has to set priorities, communicate decisions transparently, and hold stakeholders to account.Power Point and Excel don’t offer data-driven Gantt charts, which is why a lot of project managers work with a solution like think-cell. You can download a free 30-day trial to try out think-cell’s Gantt charts for your project timelines.5 steps to visualizing business data effectively This section focuses on how to build a powerful data visualization within a business presentation. For look at the whole process, you can also read our article on how to create a great Power Point presentation.Building an effective data visualization can be broken down into five steps. Understanding your audience and their needs Delivering relevant data at the right time Adapting to practical challenges of working with data Using the right structure for your visualization Presenting your visualization to drive decisions Step 1: Understanding your audience and their needs Whether you’re presenting your visualization to someone in supply chain, strategy, R&D, HR, IT, or even your CFO, always consider how much context they need to understand your story, and what unnecessary details you can eliminate.In general, it’s better to be concise, but some audiences may appreciate some additional background that supports your key points. Similarly, more technical details might help you raise your credibility and win you trust with some audiences, whereas decision-makers will be more focused on the bottom line.Understanding your audience will help you craft coherent narratives and convincing arguments. By focusing on relevance, you maximize the impact of your data visualizations and increase the chances of reaching positive business decisions.Step 2: Delivering relevant data at the right time One thing all business decision-makers have in common is that they value their time. If your CEO is giving you half an hour to present, then you want to respect their time by sharing clear visualizations that are relevant to the decisions they are currently facing.Focusing on what’s most relevant isn’t always easy when you’ve been working on complex issues with multiple influencing factors. One approach is to break down your story into bite-size chunks. If you have a chunk that doesn’t contribute a valuable message, you probably don’t need to make a data visualization for it.Also think about timing. For example, it might make sense to provide an overview of total sales early in the quarter, and more detailed breakdowns by brand, category or territory later on. Thinking about the decisions you are hoping to support can help inform which data is most relevant, and when.A strategic approach will make the communication process smoother and your visualizations more effective. Let your decision-makers knows what to expect from your presentation, including which data you are going to share. This will create a receptive, productive environment that is geared towards better decision-making.Step 3: Adapting to practical challenges of working with data Before choosing which chart type to use to communicate your message most effectively, there are a few practical aspects of data preparation that you need to consider: Availability: Which relevant data exists and which formats\\xa0is it available in? Accessibility: How can how the data be obtained? Does the team have relevant access and are there incremental costs from licensing, subscription fees or training to use the software? Are specific authorizations required? Time constraints: How long will it take to gather the data, clean it and convert it into a meaningful visualization. By adapting to real-life circumstances and making pragmatic choices, you can avoid frustration and ensure that you know from the outset the kind of data you will be working with. With practical issues resolved, you have more time to focus on preparing a visualization that will represent your data in the best possible way.Step 4: Using the right structure for your visualization Technology can be of great assistance throughout the entire process, from sourcing and compiling your data, to converting it into suitable visualization and presenting it. When choosing the right tools, you should consider whether your audience will be interacting with your visualizations directly, or consuming it as part of a presentation.When your audience prefers to work with the data themselves, filtering and adjusting according to their specific needs, your data visualization should fulfil two main criteria: Valid information: Imagine a marketing manager who needs to evaluate the success of different advertising campaigns. If the data provided is inaccurate or outdated, the manager might make critical decisions based on flawed insights, leading to ineffective allocation of resources, and missed opportunities. A flexible tool: Consider a sales team working on a diverse portfolio of products and regions. A rigid reporting tool that cannot accommodate different data views or customize metrics may hinder their ability to analyze performance effectively. Often, it will be your role to analyze the data and present it to the decision-maker along with your recommendations. This is where you need an ad-hoc Power Point presentation with a clear narrative. You create the story and build the presentation, using the right visualizations to support your argument and providing all the necessary insights for making an informed decision.If you’d like to learn more about creating dashboards and ad-hoc presentations from complex datasets, you can read our blog article on building data visualizations from pivot tables.Step 5: Presenting your visualization to drive decisions Once you’ve identified your audience, which data to work with, and the best structure for sharing it, the final step is presenting your data visualization in a way that will drive decisions.All the work and effort invested in analyzing the data will be worthless if you don’t communicate it effectively. Data visualization is a subject you can fill degree courses with, but here are a few key points to consider that are particularly relevant when visualizing data in a business environment. Share accurate data: The best way of torching your credibility in an instant is to share inaccurate or inconsistent data. Make sure your data is up-to-date and doesn’t contradict itself. Ideally, your visualization should always be linked to your data source so that it’s always correct even if the data changes. Avoid information overload: Apply the “less is more” approach and\\xa0the pyramid principle. Simplicity and minimalism are the essence of clear communication. Instead of overwhelming the audience with excessive data or lengthy content, focus on distilling information to its most important elements. Focus on your message: Internalize the main message of a visualization and remove any unnecessary information. Don’t hide important details, but if the global average will only distract from what you’re trying to say, take it out. Highlight what counts: Use colors selectively to highlight a specific column or datapoint you want to draw attention to. If you’re choosing something to highlight, follow through with it and make this the main message of your visualization. Don’t pick out one column and focus your annotations on something unrelated. Provide context: Add difference arrows, data labels and annotations where they are useful. Don’t overload your chart but do share valuable context with your audience to help guide their decisions. Double down on the details: If your chart has inconsistent number formatting or alignments, it distracts from what you’re trying to say. You maximize the credibility of your message if your charts look professional. Stay on brand: If your company uses a standardized set of colors and fonts, this is key part of their visual identity so stick to it. Even for internal business presentations, you’re representing your company and you make a professional impression by following guidelines and sticking to templates.

Discover your library and new tools. Find the right visualizations for your presentation        Resources     Content hub    Find the right visualizations for your presentation    9 min read  — by Akash Choudhary In the world of data analysis and presentation, finding the perfect visualization to convey your message is key. It\\'s not just about presenting numbers; it\\'s about telling a story that resonates with your audience. Let\\'s explore how you can find the right visualization for your presentations.Contents Understand the data Before diving into visualization options, it\\'s crucial to understand the data you are working with. What are the key insights you want to communicate? Are there any patterns or trends you need to highlight? Let’s take a look at this below table showcasing quarantine internet activities across different age groups during COVID.Presenting such a table allows the audience to draw their own insights and conclusions. Rather than leaving it to the audience, the presenter should focus on conveying a key message and then use appropriate visualizations to support that message. For example, if the goal is to highlight that Millennials spent the most time searching for COVID updates compared to other age groups, a column chart displaying this specific data point would be much more effective, as shown here.Explore qualitative, quantitative and text slides Understanding the different types of slides and when to use them is essential for effective visualization. There are three main categories of slides: quantitative slides, qualitative slides, and text slides. Quantitative slides primarily focus on presenting data using simple charts like bar charts, column charts, line charts, and others. On the other hand, qualitative slides, also known as conceptual slides or infographics, are used to present facts, build logical structures, and convey arguments. These slides include various chart types such as process cycles, organograms, and decision trees, depending on the nature of the information being presented. Text slides, which should be used sparingly, are reserved for presenting summaries or key points.Understand attributes of quantitative charts Understanding the attributes of common quantitative charts is crucial for effective data presentation. The bar chart is ideal for showcasing rankings, such as the ATP tennis world rankings or the Forbes most valuable brands ranking. On the other hand, the column chart is best suited for displaying development or growth over time, with years typically labeled on the X-axis. Line charts excel in illustrating long-term trends and projections, making them popular for displaying stock data.Ultimately, selecting the right chart type depends on the specific data being presented and the message the presenter wants to convey. Simple \"chart chooser\" tools available online can be invaluable for individuals seeking guidance on selecting the appropriate chart type for their data. These diagrams typically present a visual flowchart or decision tree that guides users through a series of questions about their data and intended message. By following the branches of the chart, users can narrow down their options and identify the most suitable chart type for their specific needs.   Transform text slides to qualitative slides Transforming text into qualitative charts enhances the visual appeal and clarity of presentations. Take a look at the ‘bad’ example below. The process begins with condensing the text to its essence, ensuring it is to the point. Next, titles and text are separated, arranging them like columns in a table, facilitating a structured layout. Applying the color scheme of the presentation adds coherence and reinforces branding.  Consulting your slide library to select appropriate templates, which can then be customized to suit the content.  Don\\'t have a template library?No problem. Unlock the potential of your presentations with our curated collection of dynamic Power Point slide templates!   Highlighting keywords helps emphasize key concepts, aiding comprehension at a glance, especially for busy executives.  The use of icons can further enhance understanding if they are used repeatedly across a presentation, serving as so-called \\'navigators\\'. Placing them on the upper right of the respective slides ensures that readers instantly understand which section they are currently in, even without naming the section. A small disclaimer: Ensure you know your audience\\'s preferences beforehand—some people love icons, while others hate them. If you are unsure, it\\'s better to avoid using icons in your first interaction with the audience. By following these steps, text-heavy slides can be transformed into engaging, informative visuals, ensuring effective communication of ideas and insights.In conclusion, finding the right visualization for the information that you want to present requires careful consideration, experimentation, and iteration. By understanding your data, simplifying your message, enhancing with color and icons and tailoring to your audience you can create impactful visualizations that effectively communicate your message and insights.

Discover your library and new tools. 7 tools to boost your Power Point productivity        Resources     Content hub    7 tools to boost your Power Point productivity    6 min read  — by Stephen Bench-Capon When you’re creating a high-stakes Power Point presentation, you never want to sacrifice quality, so you’ll often end up sacrificing time. Simply working faster can lead to misalignments and inconsistencies that can damage your credibility, however well-constructed your messaging and storyline might be. In this article, we introduce seven tools that will speed up your Power Point work and give you a significant amount of time back, without compromising on consistency: Align and resize Replace and resize fonts Insert symbols Switch decimal symbols Change proofing language Save or send slides Clean up and sanitize You can read detailed instructions on where to find these tools and how to use them, including all options and functionalities, in our user manual.SPOILER: The tools covered here are all available within the think-cell Suite. You can download a free 30-day trial today and see first-hand the difference they can make to your Power Point productivity.1. Align and resize Being able to align and resize objects in Power Point efficiently is a huge time-saver. Without exception, every object on a slide should be the right size and every object should be correctly aligned. And this won’t happen by chance.As well as Power Point’s in-built options, think-cell users also benefit from three additional resizing functions that are an invaluable complement to alignment. If you’ve ever typed in 9.87 cm to set the width of a rectangle—and then changed it to 9.89 cm when your layout shifts—you’ll know how fiddly manual adjustments can be.Same Width, Same Height, Same Size: three simple-sounding, yet powerful buttons that will ensure your slides look slick. And because they work just like Power Point’s native functions, you can align, resize and distribute your elements seamlessly, intuitively, and without having to use a numeric keypad.2. Replace and resize fonts The process of building a presentation often means compiling information from a range of sources and copying text into your slides before editing and arranging it. Depending on exactly how it’s inserted, a text will often retain its original font and formatting, wreaking havoc on your otherwise consistent slide appearance.If it’s just one footnote, you can probably fix it yourself, but if you’ve got a full presentation of complex slides with texts coming from multiple sources, you’ll want a tool like replace and resize fonts. With a couple of clicks, you can instantly set your whole presentation to your corporate typeface, including chart annotations and even slide masters. Comic Sans has nowhere to hide.3. Insert symbols Power Point has a menu that lets you insert a vast range of symbols you can’t normally type with your keyboard. Unfortunately, as there are over a thousand symbols and no meaningful search function, you can waste a lot of time hunting before you find that elusive sum (∑) or plus/minus (±) symbol.That’s why think-cell’s insert symbols tool is so valuable. It cuts the fluff and gives you what you need for business presentations in one clear menu. No scrolling. No emojis. No Wingdings.4. Switch decimal symbols Decimal symbols might seem like a minor detail, but 1.234 means something very different to 1,234. In an important business presentation, you’d probably prefer if your numbers weren’t off by a factor of a thousand.Particularly when collaborating internationally, it’s easy for decimal points and commas to get mixed up when users with different regional settings edit or add slides. Going through a presentation and checking every single figure of every single chart isn’t the most rewarding experience, and even then you might miss something.The switch decimal symbols tool lets you target all your presentation’s charts in one go. This gives you the peace of mind to be able to share your budget with your European colleagues without accidentally slashing their quota by 99.9%.5. Change proofing language Another common cause of headaches can be your presentation’s language settings. Everyone might be writing in English, but when you run the spellchecker, you’ll see perfectly correct words flagged as spelling mistakes. This can easily happen when people based in different countries contribute to the presentation and Power Point retains the local language for each slide.Setting the language in Power Point is a tedious exercise, as you can only do it for one slide at a time. For a presentation of any meaningful length, you’ll want to use think-cell’s change proofing language tool, which you can apply to the whole presentation at once to save time, cut out errors and only see that squiggly red underline when you’ve made a genuine spelling mistake.6. Save or send slides There’s little point building a top-notch presentation if you don’t show it to anyone. But often you’ll need feedback on individual slides before your presentation is really top-notch enough to be shared around.Sending someone a largely unfinished presentation when they only need to see one slide is a recipe for confusion. With send slides, you select exactly what you want to share. This level of control keeps your communication efficient, respects your colleague’s time, and means you won’t get helpful comments on slide 47 asking if ‘Think of a good action title to go here’ is the best choice of heading.7. Clean up and sanitize Whenever you’re sharing slides in a business environment, there’s always a risk of oversharing. Forgetting internal comments or presentation notes can easily cause you mild embarrassment and, in extreme cases, could even harm your career.It’s always best to leave just the on-slide content and remove information you’d rather not share, even from the file’s metadata. Use clean up and sanitize to ensure you’re delivering a polished piece of work and avoid leaking need-to-know information to someone who really doesn’t need to know.Build better presentations faster with think-cell Toolsthink-cell Tools are part of our commitment to supporting every stage of the presentation creation journey.

Our latest release doesn’t just build on what has gone before. It also marks a significant broadening of scope. We’re embracing the fact that think-cell is no longer just a Power Point add-in primarily focused on charts, but an all-in-one solution for creating best-in-class presentations. This is the think-cell Suite.\\xa0While the think-cell Suite now brings increased efficiency into areas of presentation creation we hadn’t previously touched, it’s still think-cell. Your presentations won’t break, you won’t need to upgrade your computers, and we’re not getting rid of our headphone jack.\\xa0Watch the video to see how the think-cell Suite can transform the way you work with Power Point:The think-cell Suite is available to everyone who is already working with think-cell. If you don’t have think-cell installed, you can easily download a free 30-day license and get instant access to all the latest features:Supporting every stage of the presentation journey Our mission at think-cell has always been to help you present your data in the best possible way. Clear, consistent charts are at the heart of convincing storytelling and effective decision-making. But charts don’t exist in a vacuum. And think-cell has been about more than charts for a while now. Smart text boxes and chevrons for process flows are the kinds of features that have been helping our users build not just great charts, but great slides. In the past, think-cell features expanded incrementally. New releases would include a few slide-building or collaboration features to enhance what remained a charting solution. With the think-cell Suite, we’re now fully committed to the whole presentation journey, from the moment you open Power Point to the moment you’re done—whether your slides include any charts or not.Get more detail on the latest features of the think-cell Suite in our comprehensive release notes: What’s new in think-cell 13?Enhancing consistency and collaboration Equipping everyone with the same capabilities raises the floor and helps set new standards within your company. We already ensured compatibility across operating systems back with think-cell 10, but the think-cell Suite now includes several more features designed to support consistency and aid collaboration between teams:\\xa0 Shared foundations: Access a comprehensive library of professionally-designed slide templates, so every presentation starts with the best-possible foundations—whoever’s working on it.\\xa0 Brand compliance: Make master decks and individual slides easily available throughout the organization, ensuring that all internal and external presentations are on-brand and on point.\\xa0 Flexible file-sharing: Keep your data links intact when presentations are renamed, moved or sent via email, guaranteeing that your charts are always accurate and you can work productively when reviewing, updating and consulting across teams.\\xa0 For all collaborative features, think-cell applies existing permissions and access protocols, letting you scale the benefits of think-cell across teams and organizations, without compromising on security.\\xa0Learn more about how everyone in your organization can build beautiful, on-brand presentations: with the think-cell Library.\\xa0Expanding scope while staying streamlined Increasing efficiency has always been a fundamental principle driving think-cell’s development. From technical stability to our unique layout algorithm and time-saving UI: everything about our software is geared towards efficiency.\\xa0However, maintaining ease of use becomes more challenging as a feature set expands into new areas: Slide templates fall under design, clean-up is part of collaboration, and aligning and resizing are fundamental tools used within the slide-building process.\\xa0Our solution? The think-cell tab.Just as you can build, format and optimize your chart without leaving the chart area, the think-cell tab now lets you build, format and optimize all aspects of your slide without hunting around for the powerful features you rely on.\\xa0This isn’t limited to Power Point.

Creating a slide with maximum efficiency: the one-tab Power Point challenge        Resources     Content hub    Creating a slide with maximum efficiency: the one-tab Power Point challenge    27 min read  — by Stephen Bench-Capon Power Point is full of useful features, but navigating the various tabs, menus and sidebars to actually find the function you need can be a huge drain on your productivity. Some things seem hidden away, and even if you do know where something is, it might require several clicks before you get to it. Minimizing mouse clicks has always been a key aim of our charting software, and now, with the release of the think-cell Suite, our users can also work with the think-cell Power Point tab. The think-cell tab brings together all the most important tools needed for creating business presentations and makes them accessible from a single location.To show you how to work with the think-cell tab and to demonstrate the impact it can have on your efficiency, we’ve set ourselves a challenge: can we build a professional Power Point slide with just the tools available on a single tab?The think-cell tab is available as part of the think-cell Suite, which you can try for yourself by downloading a free 30-day trial:The anatomy of a Power Point tab Power Point tabs are part of a hierarchical framework that is designed to create a smooth, intuitive user experience by grouping related commands together. The following are the most important definitions within this framework: Ribbon: The set of toolbars at the top of the window in Power Point. Tabs: The individual toolbars within the ribbon, such as Home, Insert or Help. Command groups: The sections of each tab where related tools are found, such as Slides, Font or Paragraph. Also referred to as groups. Menus: A set of tools that can be expanded to access the individual commands, indicated by a down arrow next to the icon and/or name. Commands: The individual tools within a command group, represented by an icon and/or the name of the command. Setup: giving yourself the best chance of success If you’re trying to maximize efficiency by keeping tab-switching to a minimum, then you can’t afford to give up valuable screen real estate to functions like Dictate and Convert to Smart Art. For the best possible experience, you’ll want something purpose-built for efficiency. You’ll want the think-cell tab.Customize your toolkit to suit your style In this article, we’ll be using the default think-cell tab layout to keep things simple. But of course, as you get used to working with any piece of software, you’ll develop your own preferred workflows and discover your own favorite way of organizing things.That’s why the think-cell tab is fully customizable. You can position it where you like within the Power Point ribbon and you can choose which command groups, menus, and tools are included, as well as their precise arrangement along the tab.Access the resources you need Once you’ve got your think-cell tab installed, it pays to do some groundwork before launching into slide production. For a business presentation, you’ll want access to your corporate templates. You don’t want to get bogged down constructing layouts from scratch when you’re supposed to be focusing on your content.The best way to prepare is to add relevant presentations and any other useful assets to your think-cell Library. You can do this at any time but we’d recommend setting things up before you start so you don’t have to break your creative flow once you’re nicely in the presentation building zone.If you haven’t tried out the think-cell Library yet, you can download a free 30-day trial with full access to the full range of features. Never start from a blank slide again:Execution: building a slide of increasing complexity When building our slide, we’ll start by adding the foundational content and go through three levels of increasing complexity to explore a range of business presentation workflows: Level 1: Creating a slide, adding a chart and populating the content Level 2: Supporting the story with data for more sophisticated messaging, while ensuring accuracy Level 3: Adding annotations, polishing formatting and getting the slide presentation-ready All of these tasks should be possible from the think-cell tab. Clearly, if you were adding ink annotations, you’d need the tools on the Draw tab. Or you could customize your think-cell tab by adding the requisite commands. But that’s a specialized task. The default think-cell tab is designed to prioritize what matters most and avoid distractions from anything less-than-critical for business presentations.Level 1: Creating a slide, adding a chart and populating the content Let’s avoid staring at a blank slide and start with a template from the think-cell Library. You can find inspiration and get started straight away, knowing that you’re working with something that has been carefully composed and is fully brand-compliant.With the slide in, the next step is to replace the chart. The think-cell Library templates are a good source inspiration but you’re unlikely to find something that matches the precise structure of your dataset, so inserting a new chart is usually the best option. You’ll find Charts right next to Library in the think-cell tab.The datasheet opens automatically when we insert the chart. Once we’ve added our data, we can do some first adjustments and make the chart more focused by moving some of the less important series into ‘Other’. Because it’s a think-cell chart, we can do all our formatting without even leaving the chart area, let alone needing to switch tabs.Visit our features page to find out more about the formatting and annotation options available with think-cell Charts.The next step is adding some content to the slide. Our chosen template has space to provide context for three series from the column chart. We can find suitable icons in the think-cell Library and then we’ll use text boxes to show the initiatives associated with each.Besides text boxes, you’ve also got tables, shapes and checkboxes, and in the Text command group of the tab you’ve got your bullet-points and other formatting options. Having everything in the same tab makes it quick to try out different ideas and see what works best, without having to search through menus for something you might not end up using.There’s still a bit of work to do on your first draft. But editing the action title, writing a subtitle, and inserting a footnote are more about crafting the content than struggling with Power Point. And to finish it off, the tab’s Text and Color groups provide everything you need to experiment with colors and shape outlines, or make tweaks to font sizes.Level 2: Supporting the story with data for more sophisticated messaging With most of your slide elements added, you have your overall structure in place and know the story you want to tell. Now it’s time to move to the next level by adding some more powerful messaging.Supporting your arguments with precise data is a great way of making a slide more convincing, but only if your data is accurate. If your headline says 42% and your chart shows 51%, you instantly lose credibility. You can avoid this—and keep your reputation intact—by setting up a link to your Excel sheet so all data comes from the same source. If the chart updates, so will all your other on-slide values.It’s easy to establish this kind of Excel link from the Data command group, which is the next one along from the Elements group on the think-cell tab.When you link to Excel, you’ll need to select the relevant data point. In our example, we’ll add a simple formula to give us the target value we want to highlight. Linking to useful values from your Excel sheet lets you enrich annotations and headings to make your storytelling more tangible.The advantage of having your data linked is you can build your slide with provisional values and easily update it once the numbers are finalized. This lets you get ahead of the curve so you can use the time before the deadline for adding insights, rather than double-checking and fixing errors.Level 3: Adding annotations, polishing formatting and getting the slide presentation-ready Once you’ve constructed your slide and set up your data links, you should have something that’s complete and accurate, but it’s still essentially a draft. There are a few more steps to take before your slide is ready to present. In particular: Create balance between the on-slide elements by aligning objects and giving them room to breathe. Highlight what’s important by using color or other means of drawing the audience’s attention to key messages. Polish your slide by checking consistency across aspects like formatting, fonts, spelling and decimal points. All of these tasks can be completed directly from the think-cell tab, with the Layout, Color and Quality command groups providing everything you need.This stage of editing, when your slide is nearly finished, is also where you have a chance to add any flourishes. As your deadline approaches, you’ll often think of another annotation or an elegant way of visually linking elements that will help bring your message home.You don’t want to make breaking changes at a late stage, but with the think-cell tab, any ideas you have can be quickly and flexibly implemented. You have the library to access icons and images, you have the shapes to add extra callouts, you even have Harvey balls you can use to succinctly provide valuable context.If late edits cause shifts in your layout, you’ve got your alignment tools to make sure everything is still on point and ready for review. To prepare the slide for sharing—as you can probably guess by now—you don’t even have to leave the think-cell tab. You’ve got two think-cell Tools, Clean up and Send slides, right where you need them in the Quality and Collaboration command groups. Next steps: building complete presentations and adding customization While you can always add further enhancements or polish, we’ve now got a slide with a clear main message, a data-driven chart, insightful annotations, and additional context for the audience. All aligned and presented to a professional standard. And all without leaving the think-cell tab.As this article has only focused on one slide, we haven’t covered the think-cell tab’s full range of commands. If we’d been building an entire presentation, we would have also used the Structure group, which is where you can create an agenda with chapters and a table of contents.Besides Structure, the only command group we didn’t touch was More, which provides easy access to online resources like our user manual or video tutorials.That’s the default tab, but don’t forget you can also customize it to fit your way of working. This could be adding a favorite command, removing a command you don’t need, or simply rearranging what’s already included. The think-cell tab lets you make whatever adjustments you like to make your Power Point workflows more efficient and free up time and headspace for creativity.Try out the think-cell tab to see how it can enhance your Power Point efficiency in your free 30-day trial:Read more: 7 tools to boost your Power Point productivity  This article runs through 7 tools that will speed up your Power Point work and help you build polished slides faster, without compromising on consistency.

How to develop and automate financial planning & analysis dashboards        Resources     Content hub    How to develop and automate financial planning & analysis dashboards    12 min read  — by Akash Choudhary Dashboards are an essential financial planning and analysis (FP&A) reporting tool that managers use to review metrics and make decisions quickly. In the past, creating FP&A dashboards required specialist staff to build reports using custom spreadsheets or tools.This has changed dramatically in recent years. With improved software, growing data literacy, and more accessible data, anyone can easily develop automated FP&A dashboards that can help drive business decisions.In this article, we look at how to develop valuable FP&A dashboards, we explore the importance of automation for accurate financial reporting, and we show how think-cell can meet the FP&A needs of companies who aren’t yet ready to invest in a costly ERP software solution.think-cell’s advanced Excel linking and industry-leading charts make it easy to automate all kinds of financial reports and dashboards. Download a free 30-day trial to try it yourself:What are FP&A dashboards?FP&A dashboards have evolved from a collection of Excel tables and graphs to advanced visualizations built with dedicated software. Another development in the use of FP&A dashboards concerns their scope. As the role of FP&A has grown within companies, reports have also expanded to include key performance indicators (KP Is) from other departments, as well as the core financial numbers.To provide the context a decision-maker needs, FP&A dashboards might include KP Is related to pipelines, marketing campaigns, supply chain performances, and more. FP&A dashboards can play a key role in helping businesses understand the interconnectivity between different KP Is and functions.Principles of good FP&A dashboard design While FP&A dashboards have the specific aim of making financial planning and analysis insights accessible, they are still dashboards. As such, many of the principles of good data visualization—and specifically good dashboard design—also apply in an FP&A context.One important work on dashboard design that is still referenced today is Stephen Few’s 2006 book, \"Information dashboard design: the effective visual communication of data.\" \\xa0Few’s definition of a dashboard includes the following criteria: It should be a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve objectives. It should be consolidated on a single screen. It should be monitored and understood at a glance. In addition to these fundamentals of dashboard design, there are some more practical features of data visualizations that are needed to provide value in a business context, with FP&A again being no exception: Data accuracy: Any chart, report or dashboard that shows wrong data is useless at best, and harmful at worst. Automation: Dashboards are most helpful when they update automatically with their data source. Manual steps slow businesses down, and create the possibility of the dashboard being viewed with out-of-date information. Brand compliance: FP&A dashboards that are shared with decision-makers have enhanced credibility if they reflect the brand’s visual identity. Mismatched colors and fonts lower trust in the overall presentation and can create distractions that get in the way of making effective business decisions. Adhering to the principles of good dashboard design requires a combination of understanding how to apply them and choosing the right software solution to make it possible. One of think-cell’s strengths when building dashboards is its powerful Excel linking, which has several advantages over Power Point’s native solution.Theoretical framework for developing FP&A dashboards Thorough planning is vital for ensuring your FP&A dashboards fulfil their ultimate objectives and provide the business impact to justify their development. To aid planning and check that all relevant aspects are considered, it can be useful to follow a set framework, such as the following: Define the audience of your dashboard Identify the objectives of your FP&A dashboard Select the data to include in your FP&A dashboard Collaborate with other functions on dashboard design 1. Define the audience of your dashboard The first step to creating an impactful FP&A dashboard is the same as for almost any report, data visualization or presentation: know your audience. It’s a cliché, but it’s crucial to begin by clearly\\xa0identifying who you are building the dashboard for, and how your audience will interact with it.Some dashboards are built primarily for exploration, which means giving your user access to filters and slicers. Others are built to be presented in a more static state that highlights the key findings of an analysis. How your audience is going to consume the information is of fundamental importance for dashboard design.By answering these questions, you can refine the scope and content of your dashboard, ensuring that it provides relevant and valuable insights, without distracting from the key messages with unnecessary options or datapoints.Let’s say that you aim to improve sales efficiency by creating a sales performance dashboard. Your audience could be made up of different people, each of whom is interested in the dashboard for their own reasons: Sales representatives need individual performance metrics and pipeline analysis. Regional managers require insights into regional performance and revenue. The sales director needs a high-level overview of overall sales performance. Considering each audience\\'s specific needs will help you provide relevant insights and support data-driven decisions to boost sales performance. However, you will only get this right if you plan for it from the outset. The complexity of FP&A dashboard design, particularly when combining multiple data sources, means that late changes to appease a particular stakeholder can be costly to implement and derail the project.With the right planning, you have a better chance of spotting challenges early on before you have made any expensive decisions. For example, you might decide to create separate FP&A dashboards highlighting different aspects of performance, which is the kind of decision you want to make as early as possible in the process.For more insight into the difference between exploratory dashboards and charts built for ad-hoc presentations, you can read our article on using Excel pivot tables in Power Point presentations.2. Identify the objectives of your FP&A dashboard Showing the information needed to achieve the dashboard’s objectives was the first of Stephen Few’s design criteria. So, before you can identify which information is most important, you need to define what your dashboard’s objectives actually are.You can explore and define objectives by addressing the following issues: Timeframe: Is your dashboard reporting on short-term targets, such as the current month or quarter, or is it supposed to provide insights for the whole budget cycle? Forecasting and benchmarking: What is your dashboard tracking and is it supposed to forecast future performance? For example, a dashboard can track actual sales versus forecast, monitor sales quota achievements, compare company performance to industry benchmarks etc. Breadth and depth: Are you creating the dashboard to share operational KP Is with operational teams or are you providing enterprise-level metrics for the C-suite and board of directors? For example, regional management teams may require in-depth views of different markets, while the C-suite and the board of directors might be more interested in a dashboard showing daily revenue trends. Reproducibility: Is this dashboard a one-off or is it part of a series? If you are creating multiple dashboards, it may help to create a template of a dashboard that contains a similar, coordinated layout. This will speed up your development process and make it easier for users to compare metrics from different dashboards, should the need arise. A good approach to defining objectives is to consult your audience and ask them to be as concrete as possible regarding the questions they have. If your FP&A dashboard can provide answers to your audience’s questions, there’s a very good chance it’s fulfilling its objectives.3. Select the data to include in your FP&A dashboard Based on your objectives, you should be well placed to define which data to include in your FP&A dashboard. You can divide dashboard data into two tiers of information: First-tier data should include KP Is that are critical to the business. For example, revenue trends, margins, pipeline, etc. These are KP Is that are not likely to change often. Second-tier data\\xa0may be KP Is that can change as the business switches its focus. Dashboards can include data for various business drivers, for example, pricing, marketing investments, forecast accuracy, etc. Dashboards should be flexible enough to accommodate short-term initiatives, and such flexibility can only result from proper planning at the outset. Many dashboards will include a combination of first and second-tier data, both of which can be FP&A metrics or KP Is related to other functions. In all cases, it’s crucial that the data you present is relevant to your audience and supports your dashboard’s objectives. Challenge the inclusion of any KP Is and confirm that they are helping to effectively measure progress, provide meaningful insights and support informed decision-making.4. Collaborate with other functions to design the dashboard FP&A mustn’t operate in a silo. To support different business functions in tracking their KP Is, FP&A professionals should\\xa0work with other teams, including them as much as possible during the design phase. For example, in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries, the forecasting of production and inventory levels are heavily reliant on sales forecast by each product segment.On the one hand, the forecasting of product sales will roll up and become the sales forecast. At the same time, the product sales numbers are needed by supply chain teams for production planning and inventory management. FP&A professionals need to understand how dashboards can provide each function with the data they need to support their specific activities.Implementation of your FP&A dashboard Once you have gathered all the information you need about your audience, objectives and data, and included input from all stakeholders, you are ready to build your FP&A dashboard. Here, we’ll run through things you can do to make your dashboard a success and provide real value to your business.Ensure data integrity for consistent financial reporting One common mistake is that teams may use different data sources for the same KP Is. For example, FP&A may use data from the accounting system to report marketing spend, while the marketing team may monitor campaign spending with another system, and aggregate this as their marketing spend.When different teams use different data sources to report on the same KPI, the discrepancies can undermine people\\'s confidence in your dashboard. This harms your personal credibility and negatively impacts usage of the dashboard. To ensure consistent financial reporting, it’s the FP&A team’s responsibility to provide clear definitions of KP Is and ensure that all teams use the same data source.Add value by providing insights Dashboards provide quantitative data. The FP&A team should analyze this data so they can provide commentary and identify actions that could be taken to double-down on successful initiatives or course-correct. FP&A professionals can provide added value by linking data points and advising management in their decision-making, or helping different functions coordinate their efforts to achieve broader company goals.Educate your audience to encourage dashboard use You’ve spent time and effort creating a dashboard, but you’re leaving this investment on the table if the dashboard isn’t used. The FP&A team should lead by example, using the dashboard to drive conversations and planning discussions. For example, it should form part of the regular reporting in presentations and forecast reviews.If the FP&A dashboard isn’t getting as much traction as you hoped, you should aim to establish why. It’s possible that a quick training session is all it takes to help stakeholders understand the value they can extract from the dashboard, and start using it more often in their decision-making.Exercise quality control to maintain trust Maintain trust by ensuring that dashboards go through a quality control process before they are shared with others, even within the FP&A team. There should be a clearly defined quality control step, possibly with a series of mandatory quality checks, and including the person responsible. Your FP&A dashboards will likely evolve over time, so it’s vital that data integrity is maintained as visualizations are added or adjusted.The importance of automation in your FP&A reporting Every manual step involved in updating your FP&A dashboard is a potential source of errors that can damage your credibility and lead to incorrect conclusions. That’s why automation of data updates in your FP&A dashboards is so critical for ensuring consistent financial reporting.If you are using Power Point to present a dashboard with financial reports, budget forecasts, performance metrics, and other KP Is, you need to be confident that what you are presenting is consistent with the underlying data. This is only possible with automation.With think-cell, users can link their dashboard presentations, whether they contain charts, tables, CAGR lines, or text-based annotations, to the underlying data sources in Excel or Tableau. This enables automatic updates of the dashboard whenever new data is available. As a think-cell user, you save time and manual effort, and ensure that your entire dashboard always provides your audience with accurate and up-to-date visuals for financial analysis and reporting.You can try think-cell for free by downloading a 30-day trial, complete with a range of dashboard templates and all automation features:Recent trends that are impacting the future of dashboards Here, we’ll look at a few trends that are impacting how FP&A dashboards are developed and affecting how they are used.Increased involvement of FP&A teams in integrated FP&A As integrated planning becomes more common, more functions will build dashboards to provide the next level of data. FP&A professionals must understand how this data is issued and keep track of data integrity to avoid disparities. This objective can be accomplished by working with different functions and incorporating data through drilldowns of the KP Is that are presented in the higher-level dashboards.Use of artificial intelligence (AI) to create dashboards With the ongoing development and continued interest in Chat GPT and similar generative AI resources, creating dashboards using AI will become mainstream, as even non-experts feel they are able to easily and quickly build dashboards to showcase their data.While AI can help in preparing dashboards, it’s important to remember the principles of good FP&A dashboard design discussed above, and follow the framework for good dashboard development. If the AI tool isn’t given sufficient information about your audience and your objectives, it might produce something pretty, but it won’t be able to build anything of real value.Also be aware of the limitations of AI’s analysis capabilities. AI can calculate simple metrics out of context like forecast against budget or year-over-year-growth, but your FP&A experts can offer much more value. FP&A professionals can provide context to the narrative, explain how external factors impacted a particular market, or anticipate how upcoming events might affect sales performance.As always, AI can help save time and eliminate errors in calculations, but your most valuable insights will likely come from your FP&A experts. And as always, it’s important to add a fact-checking process to any insights achieved via AI sources.Increased availability of self-service dashboards With tools such as Power BI and Tableau, more functions are building dashboards. FP&A should work with any teams building dashboard to ensure that data sources are consistent and sandboxed. This will reduce the risks of data disparities across dashboards. FP&A should provide quality control and standardize the definition of KP Is and terms to ensure consistency and minimize miscommunication.Using think-cell for automated FP&A dashboards Many companies understand the value of consistent FP&A dashboards, but they don’t yet have the scale and resources to invest in an ERP solution. Even with skilled staff and the best intentions, cobbling together dashboards in Excel can be frustrating and error-prone, and often fails to result in a dashboard that is used regularly and impactfully.With think-cell, companies can easily create FP&A dashboards that are automated, attractive and fully integrated into their financial reporting.

Discover your library and new tools. The meaning of data storytelling in the FP&A world        Resources     Content hub    The meaning of data storytelling in the FP&A world    5 min read  — by Akash Choudhary Data storytelling is a game changing and differentiating skill for FP&A. In the era of advanced analytics, dynamic dashboarding, and impactful data visualization, the art and science of FP&A storytelling have evolved significantly.In this blog, we will explore the essential components, and the practical steps involved in creating compelling data-driven business stories. By the end, you will have a comprehensive 7-step process to successfully build and deliver impactful narratives based on data.‘What’ is effective storytelling?It is important to clearly define what it means to be a great FP&A storyteller. It is being able to explain business results, trends and forecasts in a structured way that engages the stakeholders. It is having the ability to take complex finance data and turn it into a simple, purposeful, and impactful narrative. Consider a scenario with a technology startup. The finance professional might begin by illustrating the company\\'s revenue and expenses through a clear and concise chart. They could then weave a narrative around the startup\\'s competitive landscape, shedding light on the factors influencing its performance.For example, they might say, \"Our revenue has experienced steady growth in recent months, driven by successful product launches and strong customer adoption. However, we\\'re facing intensifying competition from industry giants, which necessitates a strategic approach to foster our market position. To sustain our upward trajectory, we must emphasize innovation, agility, and operational efficiency to differentiate ourselves and capture a larger share of the market.\" This example of effective storytelling demonstrates the ability to translate business data into a compelling narrative that engages stakeholders. By presenting a structured story of revenue growth and market expansion, the professional provides stakeholders with valuable insights and a clear understanding of the company\\'s financial performance and strategic direction. The ‘why’: The problem to be solved Why is data storytelling important for FP&A profession? FP&A is often included in ‘back office’ stereotypes which often puts them behind the scenes. Being able to be a great data storyteller helps shatter these outdated stereotypes and puts them at the forefront of the business! Great storytelling engages stakeholders who then want FP&A professionals’ counsel when faced with significant business decisions. Data is growing at a faster rate than ever before:The amount of data that businesses have access to is increasing. This represents one of the biggest challenges and opportunities for FP&A professionals. Having the ability to take vast amounts of complex data and pick out what data is most relevant for business leaders is an important skillset. This means that professionals have to discard lots of data which is often a challenge. Having the ability to do this in short time frames and find the most material data to help tell the story is key.The ‘how’: A 7-step storytelling process 1) Start with the objective Albert Einstein famously said that if he had an hour to solve a problem, he would spend 55 minutes defining the problem. This approach has some truth when it comes to storytelling. It is critical to clearly define what you are trying to solve and to then use this as a compass for the entire process. This includes documenting the objective and reviewing it with stakeholders. It includes understanding who your audience is and being clear about your approach. It is important to step back and understand the specific context, stakeholders, time frame and other important elements before you start building the story.2) Roll around in the data Another critical area after problem definition is spending time with the data and not rushing to build the story and its associated conclusions. This involves developing a structured approach to analyzing data. Starting from top and then zooming in on the areas that need the most analysis and attention. For example, is revenue the major focus area? Or is it profit margin?Once you have gained a clear understanding of what the data is telling you, it is important to apply analytical techniques. Is a net present value analysis optimal? Or is volume vs rate analysis better? Is a detailed review of product profitability the best fit? Perhaps a combination of techniques is the best approach. This process may feel slow at first, but it is critical to crystallize the story in your mind. Being deliberate with step one and two ultimately speeds up the process. 3) Develop the story using storyboarding At this stage it is important to write a rough storyline. It should be a structured approach that has a clear throughline and focus. A throughline is a consistent theme that is present in all parts of the story. The overall approach should start with the key message(s) and high-level story and then dive deeper into all the supporting content. This is analogous to using an outline to write a book or report. What are the chapters of the book? What is the content? How can analyses be incorporated into the story?4) Build the content and supporting detail (using visualization)Once the outline is built, it is important to start shaping the content. One critical element of a great story is visualization. Effective data visualization can turn numbers into compelling visuals, making it easier for stakeholders to engage with financial information.When it comes to presenting data visually, finance professionals should remember a few important tips. First, it\\'s crucial to choose the right type of visualization for the data at hand, such as graphs, tables, diagrams or infographics, depending on the information being conveyed. Second, it\\'s best to keep the visualizations simple and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary details or complicated visuals. Lastly, using color and design thoughtfully can make the visualizations more appealing and captivating. By following these guidelines, finance professionals can effectively communicate complex financial data to stakeholders in a clear and engaging manner.think-cell provides a vast number of chart options, including waterfall and Mekko charts to help with visualization of data.FP&A professionals often deal with recurring data in their presentations, data that needs to be regularly updated and presented in a consistent manner, such as financial reports, budget forecasts, performance metrics, and key performance indicators (KP Is). These professionals rely on accurate and up-to-date data to communicate insights to stakeholders. With think-cell automation, users can link their presentation charts and tables directly to the underlying data sources. This enables automatic updates of the visuals whenever the data changes, saving time and effort in manually updating the presentation and ensures that charts always reflect the most current information, providing accurate and up-to-date visuals for financial analysis and reporting.5) Write the executive summary and ‘call to action’.One of the most critical steps of a great data driven story is the executive summary. An approach for this is to use the headlines of each element of the story as a starting point and write executive summaries as condensed versions of the story. They typically fit on a page and tell the story in a structured way. They should end with a ‘call to action’ for the business. 6) Add supporting detail and remove irrelevant data The process of building the executive summary helps to understand where FP&A professionals need to dig in more. For example, if there is a significant variance on one P&L line or product line, it would be appropriate to perform additional analyses and bring in additional content into the story. It is also appropriate to put immaterial information into the appendix. Great business stories are to the point and do not have information that is distracting or irrelevant. In the context of storytelling with Power Point presentations, each slide should focus on exactly one message and supporting visualizations devoid of distractions for the audience. A ‘less is more’ strategy is a powerful secret of great storytellers. 7) Practice your presentation (content, body language, voice).Last but not least, practicing verbal delivery of the story and body language is often overlooked. Practicing is a critical process that refines your presentation and ensures it is engaging. Finding an accountability partner to critique your story is a technique that great storytellers use.Read more: How to develop and automate financial planning & analysis dashboards  Clear, accurate FP&A dashboards are vital for consistent financial reporting.

Planning for uncertainty with FP&A scenario management        Resources     Content hub    Planning for uncertainty with FP&A scenario management    5 min read  — by Akash Choudhary FP&A scenario management is an essential mindset that modern organizations should adopt to plan and make quick, informed decisions in an uncertain environment. However, most companies still struggle with old processes, static models, and outdated technologies. All of that raises a question: how and what can we change?While the business world is becoming more unpredictable, financial planning & analysis (FP&A) professionals are looking for new tools and techniques for planning and forecasting in a constantly changing environment. For example, not long back in March 2020, when the pandemic hit and the business world was full of \"dead budgets\" and unrealistic forecasts, scenario planning became a critical technique for the decision-making process.Challenges with scenario planning Many organizations are still struggling with scenario planning today. According to the FP&A trends survey 2022, only 6% of the 375 companies surveyed could run scenarios in real-time. Furthermore, only 13% of respondents claimed to be able to run scenarios in less than one day. Surprisingly, over 25% respondents cannot run scenarios at all, and 55% struggle with them for days and weeks. Depending on the business question at hand, scenarios could become useless if they take days to produce.Evolution from scenario planning to scenario management Scenario planning has been around for many years. It has been used not only for strategic planning but also for risk management and financial analysis. Practically every traditional budgeting and planning process has often included three \"classical scenarios\": the best, the worst, and the average. The reality shows that having these basic scenarios is not enough. Indeed, the events of the past years have dictated the requirement for agile and adaptable planning.John Murphy, CFO of the Coca-Cola Company, once said a phrase about the evolution of scenario planning. \"I have become less and less of a fan of the term ‘scenario planning\\' (in the last nine months)... I think of it more as scenario management than scenario planning.\"Scenario management is not just a process, it is a mindset. In other words, the traditional \"one annual plan-four quarterly forecasts\" framework does not work anymore. To manage uncertainty, FP&A professionals need to understand multiple potential states of the future and the drivers that create them. They must manage multiple scenarios on demand, collaboratively, analytically, and quickly (practically in real-time).Modern scenario management framework To fight these inefficiencies, FP&A professionals should be aware of how they can improve the situation. Most organizations typically have three distinct planning processes: Strategic planning – determines future goals of the organization and the strategies to achieve them Tactical planning – translates strategic goals into actionable initiatives in the mid-term, typically ranging from 1 to 3 years Operational planning – focuses on the day-to-day operations of the organization, usually spanning from weeks to up to a year. It details specific tasks, responsibilities, and timelines to achieve the tactical objectives The first step in developing the modern scenario management framework is harmonizing the three key planning processes in an organization. In other words, a shift from traditional to integrated FP&A is needed.How can a scenario management ecosystem be created?FP&A professionals must ensure the harmonization of all organizational planning and forecasting processes. In practice, it means that if the strategic plan changes due to new environmental factors, the connective adjustments in operational and tactical plans are automatically updated. Therefore, the best-in-class scenario management process is the ultimate goal for any FP&A department. Let\\'s read on.What is integrated FP&A?Integrated FP&A is a single and continuous framework where plans and forecasts are horizontally and vertically integrated. It is essential to understand the different layers of planning within an organization and where financial planning fits within these layers. This concept represents the coordinated departmental activities that lead to developing, assessing, and implementing \\'\\'the most likely scenarios\" to achieve corporate goals. Also, it allows businesses to evaluate and support the impact of multiple futures on demand.\"Six success factors matrix\" for integrated FP&A Now we understand that integrated FP&A is essential for modern scenario management. But how can we implement it in practice? The international FP&A board summarized six factors required for a successful journey towards integrated FP&A, following discussions and research into practical insights from leading organizations.In order to harmonize planning processes, both vertically and horizontally, professionals need to pay attention to the six aspects outlined below.1. Identifying key business drivers Both internal and external. It is important to focus on the most critical ones. For example, companies should focus on 20% of drivers that can explain 80% of the results (according to the pareto principle). Pay attention to the connection between drivers down from the strategic to operational level and up the other way. Understanding the key drivers and how they are connected to different levels of an organization must become an important, regular exercise for any modern FP&A department.2. Create a fully driver-based FP&A model Even a simple excel-based, fully driver-based model will significantly impact your ability to run scenarios. Make sure the model connects all three levels of planning. You need to understand how the key business drivers drivers are connected and model them accordingly in order to integrate all your planning and forecasting frameworks within an organization.3. Any good model should be a \"three-way model\" It should connect all three accounting statements: profit & loss (P&L), cash flow, and balance sheet. At first, it sounds simple, but from hundreds of international FP&A board meetings it has been observed that only around 20% of organizations have three-way connected models. The majority still focus on P&L with disconnected cash flow and balance sheet matrixes being used. The connected financial model is a must for the environment of constant change where cash planning is important and capital is limited.4. Integrate your essential planning processes Re-think who does what. The planning process should not be overcrowded, nor should it be too centralized. As a business partner, the FP&A professional knows all the essential information flows for planning and forecasting. It is vital to streamline your processes, models, and workflows to the essential activities. Traditionally, some organizations continue to plan down to the general ledger level and/or to every cost center. Remember to review the process to simplify and shorten it, automating repeatable tasks, and removing unnecessary ones.5. Factor in people\\'s considerations As any planning is a group exercise, review the team involved. Important considerations are: Do we have enough skilled people and are there any knowledge and experience gaps? Do the non-financial people involved understand the whole process? Does everyone involved knows the process, drivers and the underlying model? 6. Modern FP&A technology Technology is an important asset for any organization that wants to plan for uncertainty. However, it is placed at the end because it would enhance the process even more if all the above five factors are well-taken care of. If modern technology is implemented with the static model and not integrated processes, the system will only enhance the inefficiencies within your FP&A team.Read more: The meaning of data storytelling in the FP&A world  In this blog, we will explore the essential components, and the practical steps involved in creating compelling data-driven business stories.

How to use Excel pivot tables for Power Point presentations        Resources     Content hub    How to use Excel pivot tables for Power Point presentations    20 min read  — by Stephen Bench-Capon Pivot tables are so quick and powerful that they can seem almost magical to someone who discovers them for the first time. If you are used to writing formulas involving numerous COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, and INDEX MATCH functions, then you will instantly appreciate how easy it is to aggregate large volumes of data with Excel’s pivot tables.What’s less easy is turning this aggregated data into an impactful chart for a presentation.While Excel pivot tables are a great tool for data exploration, visualizing insights from pivot table data is fraught with challenges. Simply inserting a pivot chart from Excel into Power Point is possible, but it can lead to data and formatting inconsistencies. A specialized solution like think-will help maximize the impact of your analysis as part of a convincing presentation.This article covers the following points: Benefits of working with Excel pivot tables for data exploration Common business use cases of Excel pivot tables Disadvantages of Excel pivot tables Visualizing your pivot table data in Excel and Power Point Recommended solution for visualizing pivot table data Two scenarios for creating charts from pivot tables for presentations Conclusion: bridging the gap from pivot table analysis to visualization Pivot table FAQ If you’re new to think-cell and want to visualize your pivot table data more effectively in Power Point, you can download a free 30-day trial with unlimited access to all features:Benefits of working with Excel pivot tables for data exploration Pivot tables aren’t unique to Excel, but this article will focus on Excel, as it remains the most widespread tool for handling data in a business environment. Users can build pivot tables in Excel and analyze the data within the spreadsheet, and embed them in Power Point presentations.If you are new to Excel Pivot tables, or you need a refresher on how to prepare and structure your data, then you can get a quick review on Microsoft’s support page.The primary use of pivot tables is to convert large flat data tables, often with thousands of rows and dozens of columns, into a view with flexible column and row layouts that enables quick exploration and analysis. The pivot table makes it easy to run an ad-hoc analysis, exploring and slicing the data to discover insights that you wouldn’t otherwise have access to.The advantages offered by pivot tables cover the whole process, from setting up the data to analyzing it and collaborating within teams.Setting up the pivot table data Excel can parse any existing spreadsheet table, .txt or .csv file, and use it to generate a pivot table. You can export data from another tool, such as your inventory management software, Salesforce, Power BI, SAP or marketing analytics platforms, simply load it into Excel and create a pivot table. Excel reads the source data, but it doesn’t change it when creating a pivot table, so your input data remains clean and you don’t have to worry about inaccuracies. Analyzing the pivot table data Pivot tables make raw data digestible by converting large datasets into smaller summary tables. Excel pivot tables only take a couple of clicks to set up so they are a quick way of conducting an ad-hoc exploration and get a first impression of a dataset. Excel lets you choose exactly which columns you want to include in your pivot table, which lets you simplify a dataset by focusing on relevant dimensions. Pivot tables do a lot of heavy lifting for you by automating aggregations that would otherwise require convoluted, error-prone formulas. Filters can be easily applied and edited, letting you hide less relevant data points and explore the data from different perspectives. Pivot tables can be easily refreshed to include any new or updated data, Excel lets you add slicers for filters and timelines for date-picking to make data exploration easier, even for users unfamiliar with the data set. Collaborating within teams Pivot tables don’t require any programming knowledge of Python or SQL, or even Excel formulas, so non-specialists can easily work with them. Pivot tables in Excel are already embedded in the environment where many other business tasks take place, aiding file sharing, collaboration and connection to other spreadsheets Excel is fully compatible with other Microsoft Office programs so pivot tables can be easily copied and inserted into Power Point presentations or Word documents. Excel works with Power Query for teams with sophisticated requirements to build more complex data transformation pipelines that can feed into pivot tables. Common business use cases of Excel pivot tables Given the versality of Excel pivot tables, it’s not surprising that business professionals use them for a wide variety of use cases, as demonstrated by a selection of examples shared by knowledge workers: Simplifying large sets of data in a supply chain role Building reports from accounting software data exports Transforming data from SAP into a more manageable structure Creating weekly reports of quality issues Visualizing granular sales data by customer, item or region over time Preparing input data for use in other spreadsheets Summarizing large data sets in an accounting context Building reports that benefit from easy filtering and slicing These use cases confirm two things. Firstly, pivot tables aren’t restricted to specific industries. Secondly, while pivot tables are often associated with ease of data exploration, making them well-suited to ad-hoc tasks and one-off analyses, pivot tables are also used as part of the process for generating recurring reports.Disadvantages of Excel pivot tables Pivot tables are a valuable tool for turning raw data into meaningful insights, as they help reveal patterns in datasets that would otherwise be too large to analyze. But Excel pivot tables do have some disadvantages, particularly for users who are less familiar with them: Referencing cells within pivot tables works differently from referencing standard Excel cells, which can lead to errors when making calculations that refer to pivot table data. Adding calculated rows or columns to pivot tables is a clunky experience, meaning that users often have to add helper columns to their source data. Preparing and cleaning your source data for a pivot table analysis can be a time-consuming process, unless the data originates as a standard export in a reliable format. Building dashboards is possible, but the functionalities of Excel pivot tables are very limited when compared to specialist business intelligence software like Tableau or Power BI. Refreshing has to be done manually and for each pivot table individually, which can lead to inconsistencies if source data has been refreshed. As the primary purpose of pivot tables is data analysis, they have one clear disadvantage: they don’t easily allow for the creation of professional charts. The next section will look at how you can bridge the gap from a pivot table analysis to an impactful visualization that will support your storytelling.Visualizing your pivot table data in Excel and Power Point Powerful data visualization is essential for communicating messages effectively, but even rudimentary data visualization can also be a useful tool during data exploration. The starting point is the pivot table itself, which can already be considered a visualization of sorts. Small adjustments like changing number formatting, setting column widths, or displaying row and column totals can make it easier for you to digest the data and find insights.The next level of sophistication, while still not going beyond the pivot table, is conditional formatting. Excel offers a range of conditional formatting options, which can be useful if applied effectively, but which can quickly get very messy, particularly if you restructure your data after having set up conditional formatting rules.Creating a simple pivot chart from your pivot table Even with conditional formatting, table visualizations can only go so far. Your best option for exploring your pivot table data is with a pivot chart, which you can easily insert by selecting Pivot Chart from the Pivot Table Analyze tab in Excel. The dialog for inserting a pivot chart is the same as for other charts, albeit with some options (e.g., waterfall charts) not available for pivot table data.Tip: Just like ordinary Excel tables, you can press Alt + F1 from within the pivot table to instantly create a pivot chart. This will be column chart by default, but you can easily right-click to change chart type and you can also adjust the formatting if needed.Pivot charts look like other Excel charts, but they behave slightly differently, because they are tied to the data in your pivot table. Any updates to the pivot table will be automatically reflected in the chart, letting you instantly see how the data is impacted by changes you make to your columns, filters or data aggregations. Or if the pivot table data is refreshed, the pivot chart will refresh at the same time.The link between the pivot chart and pivot table helps you analyze your data quickly and discover trends worthy of further exploration. And the link even works both ways, letting you make changes directly via the pivot chart that will be reflected in the pivot table.Building an interactive dashboard from pivot table data By creating multiple pivot charts, you can use pivot tables to fuel interactive dashboards that let users explore the data from several angles at once. Filters can be used to control multiple charts simultaneously and reveal the relationships between different metrics or datasets.While specialized business intelligence platforms like Tableau or Power BI exist for this purpose, it’s perfectly possible to use Excel to build attractive, functional dashboards with charts, tables, slicers, and timelines. Particularly for single-source data environments or for medium-sized businesses, Excel will often be the most suitable dashboard solution.Whichever tool is used for the final output, pivoting the data in Excel can be a valuable way of quickly understanding its structure before setting up the data pipeline and building a complex dashboard.Limitations of Excel pivot charts for presentations Excel’s pivot charts essentially serve as an extension of the pivot table’s data exploration capabilities, rather than offering a robust data visualization experience. For all their value as a data exploration tool, Excel’s pivot charts are not often used in presentations, even though the functionality exists to copy them into Power Point. Reasons for this include: The data link between the pivot chart and the pivot table eliminates flexibility, meaning you have to remove a series from the table if you don’t want to display it in the chart. The pivot chart layout strictly follows the series and categories of the pivot table, which will often not be the layout you need. The only way to swap the series and columns in the pivot chart is to swap the rows and columns in the pivot table. This is rarely good for readability and it can sometimes break formulas by shifting or overwriting other elements on the Excel spreadsheet. Date grouping, such as by month or quarter, might be useful for understanding the data in the pivot table but it might not transfer to an attractive, readable chart. Number formats are not treated as part of the data link, so there can be misalignment between pivot chart labels and the data in the pivot table, which can cause confusion when switching between the two. The chart includes field, filter buttons and date grouping buttons that are useful for analyzing the data, but interfere with the visualization. As well as these specific features of pivot charts, you still face all the other restrictions associated with formatting charts in Excel or Power Point. And many of these—such as clunky axis labelling—are only exacerbated by the fact that pivot table data often has a more complex structure than flat table data.With think-cell Charts, it's easy to format and edit your charts so they're exactly how you need for your business presentations. You can download a free 30-day trial and start making impactful visualizations today:Reference tables as a solution to pivot table limitations A solution to the limitations of pivot charts is to decouple the pivot table data from the chart. Breaking the link between chart and table makes the pivot chart less useful for exploration, but it gives you more flexibility to make an impactful visualization.When you set up a reference table, you have three options that can be useful depending on your scenario: Copy from the pivot table and paste values: Pasting values will capture the state of the pivot table at the moment you copy it. This can be a suitable approach if your data is finalized and you have settled on a view that you would like to visualize. It also means that you can continue to explore the data and change filters without your reference table changing. Reference the cells in formulas: Using formulas that refer to the cells in the pivot table will mean that your reference table will update if your pivot table data is refreshed, making it less prone to data inconsistencies. However, if you make changes to the structure of your pivot table, then your formulas may no longer reference the right cells. This is best if you have settled on a pivot table structure but expect the source data to be refreshed. Use GETPIVOTDATA: Working with the GETPIVOTDATA function lets you reference fields and items in the pivot table by name, so your formula doesn’t break even if the fields or items move as you restructure the pivot table. This is a powerful option but it requires more complex formulas and it can still result in errors depending on which changes are made to the pivot table data. Whichever option you use, you will encounter the fewest errors if you complete your pivot table analysis before setting up your reference table. This isn’t always practically possible, but once you have the final data structure and number of series, and you know what you want to draw attention to, you can exercise much more freedom in your visualization.Pivot tables don't refresh automatically when the source data changes, so always remember to refresh your pivot table, or your reference table won't be updated either.Linking your Excel pivot table data to Power Point With your reference table in place, you can use it as the source data for a chart, which you create and format in the usual way in Excel. To add the chart to a presentation, it’s easy to copy it from Excel into Power Point. The Paste Special tool provides a few methods to choose how you insert the chart into your presentation: Microsoft Excel Chart Object: Inserts a chart with a datasheet embedded in Power Point that lets you format the chart and edit data directly within the presentation. Linked Microsoft Excel Chart Object: Pastes a chart that’s linked to the source Excel file so that updates made in Excel will be reflected in the chart within the Power Point presentation. Picture (various formats): Creates an image (e.g., .jpg, .png) of the chart in its current formatting. Each of these options has disadvantages to be aware of: Non-linked Microsoft Excel Chart Objects can be difficult to edit in Power Point, and they create a disconnect between the chart in your presentation and the data in your spreadsheet. Linked objects can lose the connection to the Excel file if the file is renamed or moved. Pictures are only viable if your chart formatting and data are completely finalized, as changes you make after pasting will not be reflected. Knowing these drawbacks is a start to working around them, but they all mean that the standard link between your Excel pivot table and Power Point can lead to some kind of frustration.Recommended solution for visualizing pivot table data Whether you format your chart in Power Point or directly in Excel, and whether you embed the chart, paste a link or insert an image, you are still faced with a fundamental problem: you are using a data analysis tool for data visualization.It’s always preferable to use specialist solutions for specialist tasks. So, you use an Excel pivot table for your data analysis and you use Power Point for your presentations, but for data visualization, you should really be using a purpose-built data visualization solution.The think-cell Suite gives you everything you need to easily build professional charts from your pivot table data, including Excel links that are more stable and flexible than Microsoft’s standard offering. Try it for yourself in a free 30-day trial:Creating reference tables when using think-cell When you use think-cell, it’s still best practice to create a reference table to decouple the pivot table data for your analysis from the data for your chart. There is just a slight difference, as think-cell charts require a particular data layout. For example, if you’re building a think-cell column chart, you should include a second row for category totals.For more information about ensuring your Excel data layout is set up for think-cell charts, see our user manual.Two scenarios for creating charts from pivot tables for presentations Just as pivot tables are used to generate insights in a wide range of business contexts, there are also few restrictions on how these insights are presented. To cover some of the most common cases, this section will address two general scenarios for visualizing and presenting pivot table data, and show how think-cell can help with this vital part of the decision-making process: Scenario 1: Connecting a pivot table to a recurring report in Power Point Scenario 2: Including pivot table data in an ad-hoc presentation Scenario 1: Connecting a pivot table to a recurring report in Power Point Pivot tables are widely used to create weekly or monthly Power Point reports that can be built once and simply refreshed with the new data. think-cell’s linking has two critical advantages that make automation of recurring reports from pivot tables more stable, efficient, and less susceptible to errors: Robust Excel links: The ordinary links from Excel to Power Point, generated when inserting a chart, will break if a file is moved or renamed. This can easily happen for recurring reports, particularly if new versions are saved for each iteration or they are shared amongst a broader team. think-cell Excel links are preserved even when a file is renamed, moved, sent as an email attachment, or even if the linked slide is copied to another file. Whatever happens, you never have to worry about the connection to your pivot table data being lost. Data links for text: think-cell links aren’t limited to charts or data tables. You can also link the value in an Excel cell to text in a Power Point shape or text box. This lets you reference totals or trends from your pivot table and include them in annotations that will automatically refresh in sync with your charts. Note: While think-cell’s Excel links can be set to update automatically when the data changes, Excel’s pivot tables do not update automatically with the source data. Always check your pivot table is refreshed if you want your Power Point presentation to be correct.Saving time and increasing accuracy of reports are clear primary benefits, but the secondary benefits are no less significant. With the menial aspects automated, teams have more mental capacity for analysis and ad-hoc observations. By enhancing their report with meaningful insights, they can create more value for the company, drive business decisions, and strengthen their own personal reputation.Scenario 2: Including pivot table data in an ad-hoc presentation One of pivot tables’ main strengths for data exploration is that they let the user set filters and choose the categories they want to look at. But this choice is precisely what you don’t want if you are controlling the narrative in an ad-hoc Power Point presentation. You want a fixed view of the data so that you can highlight your perspective and use it to support your arguments.think-cell’s charting capabilities let you tell exactly the story you want, without compromises. You can read in detail about think-cell charts, but three features stand out when getting the most impact from your pivot table data for your ad-hoc presentation: Auto-calculated annotations: If your pivot table shows developments over time, there will often be one category with an interesting or unexpected trend you want to highlight. think-cell makes it easy to add auto-calculated growth rates or deltas that that visually emphasize the slide’s main takeaway and help tell your story. Waterfall charts: Pivot tables are often used to sum values by category, which can form the basis of a waterfall chart showing how each category contributes to an overall change. think-cell’s industry-leading waterfall charts are much more flexible than the standard options offered by Excel and Power Point. Brand compliance: If you’ve run an ad-hoc analysis with a pivot table and you’re working at speed, then you don’t have time to worry about adjusting it to brand colors, fonts and styling. With the think-cell Library, you can easily access your company’s corporate templates. All you have to do is insert the chart into your presentation and you know that it will be on-brand and make a professional impression. Conclusion: bridge the gap from pivot table analysis to visualization Excel pivot tables are highly versatile for data analysis but you need a specialized tool to bridge the gap from exploration to visualization. The pivot table will help you draw powerful insights from a dataset but not communicate them effectively to your audience.think-cell closes the loop by integrating seamlessly into Excel and Power Point and helping you bring your pivot table data to life. think-cell also equips you with tools for creating professional business slides that will help frame your charts and make your messages as impactful as possible.If you haven’t tried it yet, you can download a free think-cell Suite trial today and get unlimited access to all features for a full 30 days:Pivot table FAQ This section answers some of the most frequently asked questions about working with pivot tables in Excel and Power Point.   What is a pivot table? A pivot table is a tool for summarizing and analyzing large datasets by totaling, counting or otherwise aggregating values. For example, a pivot table can take a large quantity of sales data with individual line items and show totals grouped by product type, region and quarter. The term ‘pivot’ is used because the source data is not changed. It is simply turned around, grouped or viewed from a different perspective e.g., by converting a column heading into row labels.   How do you create a pivot table in Excel? To create a pivot table in Excel, you first highlight your data range and select Format as Table from the Home tab. You can choose any formatting style you like but you should make sure your data has a header row as this will be needed for the pivot table.Once table formatting is applied, you can select Summarize with Pivot Table from the Table Design tab. Click OK and a new worksheet will be created with the pivot table field list in the right-hand sidebar. Here, you can select fields or drag them into the relevant areas to create your pivot table.   How do I insert a calculated field in a pivot table? To insert a calculated field in a pivot table, you first select Calculated Field from the Fields, Items & Sets menu of the Pivot Table Analyze tab. This opens the Insert Calculated Field dialog, where you can add the formula for your calculated field.If you wish to reference existing fields, you can select them from the field list and use the Insert Field button. As a simple example, if you want to calculate the sum of two fields named Price and Tax, your formula should read =Price+Tax. You can enter a title for your calculated field by typing in the name. When you are finished, simply click Add and the calculated field should appear in your pivot table.   How can you remove zero values from a pivot table? You can either remove zero values from the individual rows in the pivot table’s source data, or from the aggregated values (e.g., sums) in the pivot table itself.To remove zero values from the source data, you can add a filter by dragging the relevant field into the Filters area in the field list in the right-hand sidebar. The filter menu will appear above the pivot table, by default in cells A1 and B1 of the worksheet. To remove zero values, you then open the dropdown menu in cell B1 (by default), check Select Multiple Items and then remove the check from 0, leaving all other values checked.To remove any aggregated zero values from the pivot table, you click the filter symbol next to Row Labels in the top-left cell of the pivot table. By default this is cell A3 of the worksheet. You then select Value Filters > Does not equal, and type 0 where prompted by the dialog. Ensure that you choose the relevant field to filter from the drop-down menu.   How can I create a pivot table from multiple sheets? To create a pivot table from multiple Excel sheets, you first go to a new sheet and select the Pivot Table menu from the Insert tab. Here you choose From Data Model and click OK to specify where the pivot table should be inserted.The top window of the right-hand sidebar will now list all the available tables in the Workbook’s data model. You can click any table to expand it and select which fields you want to add to your pivot table.Creating a pivot table from tables on multiple sheets is most effective if the tables share an index or ID column that can be used to create a meaningful relationship between the tables.   How can I add a percentage to a pivot table? You can add a percentage to a pivot table in many ways, but the most common reason to add a percentage to a pivot table is to display the values in a column as a percentage of the column total. For example, you may have total sales counts by product type and you want to see each total as a percentage of all sales.To display the values as a percentage, you right-click on one of the values in the relevant column of your pivot table, and go to Show Values As in the context menu. From here, you have different options, such as % of Grand Total and % of Column Total, or you can choose % Of... and select the base field you want to reference.Read more: 7 steps for creating great Power Point presentations  Learn 7 steps for making an effective Power Point presentation, including how to structure your story, lay out your slides and create clearer, more impactful charts.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Power Point presentations        Resources     Content hub    Microsoft 365 Copilot in Power Point presentations    4 min read  — by Akash Choudhary Imagine a game-changing software that can write your emails, analyze financial reports, and take meeting notes for you. This remarkable innovation is Microsoft\\'s latest announcement in its Office apps, offering enhanced productivity and efficiency. In this blog post, we\\'ll dive into the details of Copilot, its implications for Power Point users, and the significance of human involvement in the process of creating presentations.Understanding Microsoft 365 Copilot Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI assistant that seamlessly integrates with Microsoft 365 apps such as Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook, and a suite of other essential tools. By reducing repetitive tasks, it aims to streamline work and allow for the allocation of resources towards more strategic and creative work.The think-cell team, leveraging over two decades of expertise in enhancing Power Point productivity, eagerly anticipates the positive influence of Microsoft\\'s Copilot. We are thrilled at the opportunity to integrate and expand upon Copilot, much like our successful development of innovative chart features.Microsoft 365 Copilot for Power Point Microsoft 365\\'s Copilot extends its capabilities beyond Excel and Word to include amazing features in Power Point. With Copilot for Power Point, users will be able to effortlessly convert Word documents to presentations and vice versa. It enables the creation of comprehensive presentations that consolidate data from selected Word documents.Copilot can assist in adjusting text formatting, presentation styles, and animation timing, all based on your prompts and requirements. What sets Copilot for Power Point apart is its natural language processing capabilities where users can effortlessly command Copilot using language instructions.Copilot also offers a convenient summarization function, enabling users to condense lengthy presentations into concise versions. This feature not only summarizes the key points of the presentation but also generates accompanying speaker notes for reference.The future of presentation creation?Copilot offers the potential to save time by summarizing existing documents and retrieving accurate information. Simply instruct Copilot in your Microsoft 365 app to \"Create a presentation (or a document) based on ABC file,\" and it will provide a starting point. However, it\\'s important to note that Copilot may not cover all the requirements. It may not adhere to your firm\\'s specific format or include essential slides like references or sources, meaning it might not reach 100% or even 50% completion for your needs. Even with its potential, it will never achieve perfection, nor does it aim to do so. The name itself, \"copilot,\" implies its role as a supportive assistant rather than a complete automation. Microsoft has already shared several limitations, such as its current inability to comprehend languages other than English, the absence of features like transitions, videos, or tables in Power Point, and suboptimal performance when Smart Art, tables, or charts are on the slide. For Power Point users who use data heavily in their presentations, it is hard to say how data accuracy would be played out by Copilot. Certainly not the be-all and end-all that would save us from the additional work that is required to \"do things well\".While Microsoft 365 Copilot brings immense value to Power Point users, it\\'s crucial to remember that human interaction remains an integral part of the creative journey. Despite Copilot\\'s ability to generate slides and provide recommendations, it\\'s the human touch that will bring in unique perspectives, insights, and storytelling abilities that cannot be replicated by AI alone.What do we think at think-cell?We align with Microsoft\\'s mission to enhance productivity and satisfaction in everyday work through technology. However, our primary focus remains on providing a solution tailored to the specific needs of our clients. Microsoft Copilot will be able to assist users in tackling the initial 80% of a problem across various use cases. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, Copilot will quickly generate suggestions or solution drafts. However, when it comes to creating visually compelling, complex, and professional presentations, the remaining 20% is where think-cell will shine. Our core offering revolves around creating accurate and visually compelling charts, which are tasks that the current AI is unable to replicate or improve upon with the same level of reliability and support we provide. Although Copilot has the potential to enhance the quality and efficiency of daily work, it may not address specific business challenges. At think-cell, we are excited to explore and leverage this technology to enhance upon the benefits that we have been providing for 20+ years.Read more: The importance of data visualization for business decision-making  Understand the importance of data visualization for business decision-making and learn how to visualize business data to make your presentations more impactful.

Discover your library and new tools. Why you should change the way you think about Power Point        Resources     Content hub    Why you should change the way you think about Power Point    3 min read  — by Amos Wong Power Point is firmly entrenched around the world as the go-to presentation tool for business. However, not all presentations are given the same level of attention or have the same amount of impact.Business leaders across industries have long known the value of a great presentation. Consider the incomparably intentional presentations of Steve Jobs, or the entire industry that exists around pitch coaching in Silicon Valley circles.When it comes to the big pitch, everyone seems to know what’s at stake.But in the daily rush of, well, everything else, we forget that the presentations we make daily are just as important. They might seem like hoops we have to jump through, but their impact is huge: Something as routine as monthly financial reporting can influence the decision to acquire a new company or not. A conference presentation might attract a lot of business your way—or repel it. An implementation plan could be the difference between an in-sync team and a missed launch date. A training presentation can create positive new behaviors or waste hours of your team’s time. A strategy to transform business can change everything—or garner yawns and gather dust. Whether you’re an established leader or just starting your career, this is a paradigm shift that will pay lifelong dividends: Every presentation has the power to inspire people and change minds.Presentations shape the conversations and decisions that move business forward. And by approaching them this way, you can accelerate your growth. Here’s how:Stack the deck based on the conversation you want to have Since presentations are the backdrop (or centerpiece) of nearly every business decision, construct your deck based on how you want the conversation to go. This is two levels above “sharing the latest numbers”.Ask: What do I want to happen as a result of the conversation this presentation will drive?With this focus established, you’ll treat each slide as the super-valuable real estate that it is—one step forward in a conversation that will have real business impact.Reconsider how you’re presenting data Data can be your most powerful tool to influence business decisions—but only if you share it effectively. Simple slip-ups like displaying too much information at once or formatting and annotating your charts poorly can make even the most persuasive data ignorable or confusing.Basically, if you can’t communicate your position, nothing happens.You need visually impactful charts, slides, and stories that unlock insights, inspire, and inform the decisions that move business forward. (This is where we come in: think-cell is how experts do that.)Prioritize intuitiveness and clarity by communicating one key idea per chart and visually highlighting the “Aha!” zone. Follow Power Point best practices to create compelling slides. And when possible, tailor the data you share for your audience, considering their roles, levels, and interest areas. (Of course, this means your methods for creating great decks can’t be so laborious that this level of personalization sounds like a fantasy to you. Which may lead you to…)Realize you can’t afford NOT to optimize your use of Power Point The world is changing faster than ever. Keeping up—or better, leading the way—isn’t a race to add the most stuff to your tech stack. It’s often more impactful to spend time getting better at what you’re already spending a ton of time on.The best companies are 40% more productive than the rest. Think they’re doing that by ignoring where their workers spend hours upon hours of their day?If your company is like most, Power Point is a huge part of your current workflow—which means finding even small efficiencies can lead to huge time savings. And there are major Power Point efficiency gains waiting for you, especially when working with data: like automating manual calculations so that creation, formatting, and layout decisions take a single click.The time that goes into creating and editing Power Point presentations at your company can be highly productive—if that time is optimized for the right things, like the actual high-level thinking.Why fuss around with Power Point’s clunky built-in tools to make a Gantt chart for your project, when you could do it in a third of the time with an intelligent Power Point add-in? Power Point efficiencies like this are huge business accelerators disguised as workflow tweaks.Get more excited about all of it!This one’s a bonus. When you think about Power Point as the epicenter of business decisions, the work that goes into them suddenly becomes more interesting. You’ve reframed that monthly report as a conversational catalyst rather than an annoyance that darkens your calendar every four weeks.Treat presentations as an essential work product. Because they are. And because it’s rewarding to create something elegant, impactful, and thought-provoking, instead of dragging your feet to create yet another throwaway deck.At think-cell, we’re obsessive about making your data—your stories—shine in Power Point. Painlessly. Persuasively. Even beautifully. (Just ask the business leaders who use think-cell every day, at 9 of the top 10 business schools, 90% of the Fortune 100 and the entire DAX40.)We do this not because we love data (we do)—but because the investment in creating a strong presentation is one that changes the trajectory of business.And the sooner you start thinking about presentations as the powerful tools they are, the sooner you’ll be able to harness that power for yourself.Read more: 7 steps for creating great Power Point presentations  Learn 7 steps for making an effective Power Point presentation, including how to structure your story, lay out your slides and create clearer, more impactful charts.

The message will not appear if anti-exploit protection is disabled by deselecting Immediately close programs that have been exploited by hackers in the  Scan Preferences settings.

Source sheet: Cells A1, A3, A5 are copied > Destination sheet: A1:A5 are pasted Explanation This is a design limitation of Excel. think-cell's internal datasheet is based on Excel, but is a separate Excel process. The problem can also be reproduced without think-cell when copy/pasting non-adjacent cells into a separate Excel process.  Reproduction without think-cell: Open Excel and enter some numbers into cells A1 to A5. Select the cells A1, A3, and A5 by holding the Ctrl key pressed and clicking into these cells (as in above screenshot). Copy the selection. Start a separate Excel process by right-clicking on the Excel symbol in the task bar and clicking on Microsoft Excel\\xa020…     In Excel\\xa02013 and later, keep the ALT key pressed simultaneously to start a separate process.

Result: The unselected cells A2 and A4 are pasted as well. We have filed this issue with the Microsoft Office Support as case 112021442496011. The Microsoft Office Support says that this behavior is not documented so far, but is 'by design'.  “This behavior is by design. When you use the clipboard for copy and paste, you are using a feature that is designed to work across all office applications. Since this is the case, the clipboard uses HTML code for storing and then pasting data. The HTML code is limited to a range select and you get all the data in the range including the cells you did not select. It is creating a table in HTML code and uses this table for the paste action. This allows the clipboard to share data from Excel to other office applications such as Word, Power Point, and other instances of Excel outside this workbook. When you use Ctrl-C and then follow it up with Ctrl-V instead of using the clipboard you are using an internal Excel single instance copy feature that allows Excel to copy only the selected cells. This gives you the desired behavior. The clipboard has limits due to the fact that it shares with all office applications. The limit to the clip board was planned due to the huge amount of data that would be required to do a simple copy and paste. Large copy actions would overwhelm the system and cause huge slowdowns in performance. The HTML copy is a stripped down version of the internal copy and therefore there are differences and limits.” (Microsoft Office Support) Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

Explanation The think-cell datasheet and the datasheets of native Power Point charts in Office\\xa02013 or Office\\xa02016 use a separate Excel process. In this scenario, a default paste operation makes Excel treat the source workbook as if it was saved, leading to the recalculation if the Recalculate workbook before saving option is checked.

If your company has a Microsoft Office Support contract and you want to contact Microsoft to ask for a fix, you may refer to Microsoft case number 112060458780009.The behavior can easily be reproduced without think-cell with Office\\xa02013 or Office\\xa02016.

In Power Point, insert a new native Power Point chart via Insert > Illustrations > Chart. The chart's datasheet will open automatically. Keep it open. Copy the value from your affected workbook and paste it into the chart's datasheet. Result: Pasting the value triggers recalculation of the source workbook.

It is possible that there is quite a number of Office add-ins installed that you are not even aware of.Solution1. Start think-cell's diagnosis tool TC Diag (tcdiag.exe)think-cell includes a tool named TC Diag that can help you find out which add-in is causing the problem. TC Diag is delivered with think-cell and you can find it in the think-cell installation folder.   The installation folder is shown when you click on Tools    → About in the think-cell group on the ribbon in Power Point or Excel:     If think-cell is not running, please look for the installation folder in the default location:   Simply copy the path below including the percentage signs into the Windows Explorer Address Bar or the Start menu search box.   If think-cell is installed from an administrator account: 32-bit editions of Windows: %PROGRAMFILES%\\\\think-cell 64-bit editions of Windows: %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\\\think-cell   If think-cell is installed from an user account: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\think-cell    For 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office 2010 and later, use the version located in the subfolder \\\\x64. Start the tool by double-clicking the tcdiag.exe. Within TC Diag, you find a Power Point tab and an Excel tab, each listing the installed add-ins of the respective application. Unticking an add-in here temporarily disables it for the next start of Power Point or Excel. You may have to resize the table columns to be able to read the add-ins' names and paths.Note: Some add-ins may appear inaccessible (greyed-out) in the add-in list of TC Diag. This indicates that the add-in was installed by an administrator, but TC Diag is currently running without administrative privileges. If you have the necessary privileges you can right-click tcdiag.exe and choose Run as administrator. If this does not work please approach your company's IT support.2. Check if the issue occurs without add-ins Close all Power Point and Excel windows and make sure that there are no hidden Power Point and Excel processes running anymore:  Open the Windows Task Manager: Windows\\xa0Vista and Windows\\xa07: Task Manager > Processes. Windows\\xa08, Windows\\xa08.1 and Windows\\xa010: Task Manager > More Details > Details.  and close any POWERPNT.EXE and EXCEL.EXE processes. In tcdiag.exe, clear all checkboxes in the Enabled columns on both the Power Point and the Excel tab to temporarily deactivate all add-ins.   Start Power Point or Excel, and check if the error that you observed is still present. If it does, then it is an internal problem of the Microsoft application and most probably unrelated to any add-ins. You should make sure that you have the latest patches for your version of Microsoft Office installed, and if you have, you should look for a solution in Microsoft's knowledge base or contact the Microsoft Office Support. 3. Check if the issue occurs with think-cell alone Again, close all Power Point and Excel windows and make sure that there are no hidden Power Point and Excel processes running anymore in the Windows Task Manager. In tcdiag.exe in the Enabled columns on both the Power Point and the Excel tab, tick think-cell and untick all other add-ins.   Start Power Point or Excel, and check if the error that you observed is still present. If it does, then this seems to be a problem triggered by think-cell. Please contact us as described below. 4. Check if the issue occurs with some other add-in or with a combination of add-ins Check the presence of the error for different combinations of add-ins. For each combination: Close all Power Point and Excel windows and make sure that there are no hidden Power Point and Excel processes running anymore in the Windows Task Manager. In tcdiag.exe in the Enabled columns, choose a certain combination of add-ins. For example you can try all other add-ins apart from think-cell, and combinations of think-cell and one or two other add-ins.      Start Power Point or Excel, and check if the error that you observed is still present. Repeat step 1. - 4. until you have established a minimal combination of add-ins that triggers the error. If the error occurs when think-cell and another add-in is active, please contact us and the other vendor as explained below. If the error occurs when think-cell is not active, think-cell is most likely not involved in the error. In this case please contact the vendors of the add-ins that need to be active to make the error occur. Contact support If the problem no longer occurs when think-cell has been disabled, please contact our support team. If the problem only occurs if think-cell and some other add-in are enabled together, you may either: provide us with an installable version of the other add-in, or contact the other vendor, who can then either give us a test version of his product or do the troubleshooting himself. In case the other vendor wants to do the trouble-shooting, he may contact us to obtain a test license of think-cell. It is possible that on close examination we determine that the problem lies with the other add-in. In this case, our experience shows that the vendor often will not act if we contact him directly. Instead, you as the customer must open a support case with the vendor. Please pass on our full contact data and let them know that we are happy to provide a more detailed explanation.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

Then use Excel formulas, like the SUM function, to calculate the individual totals for the other series. This has two advantages: The total column stretches to the baseline automatically. Without the e segment, the chart would not be able to identify the total column, and you would have to drag its connector manually. The total column accurately extends right to the baseline even if there are rounding errors or similar problems in other segments. Explanation In think-cell's waterfall chart, the e segment automatically stretches between the values to which its ends are connected. If only one end of the e segment is connected to a specific value, it automatically stretches to the baseline, typically calculating the total of the waterfall.You can have stacks (columns) consisting of multiple series in the waterfall chart. However, you can only have a single e segment per stack. If you use multiple e within a single stack, then all segments except one will collapse, and the remaining segment will stretch the entire extent.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

Each time a cell is selected in Excel, every single Excel add-in (including think-cell) is notified about this selection change event, which slows down the macro considerably. Especially macros that are created using the macro recorder are prone to this kind of problem. Office blog: \"What is the fastest way to scan a large range in Excel?\" MSDN: Improving Performance in Excel\\xa02007: \"Reference Excel objects such as Range objects directly, without selecting or activating them\" (in the section, \"Faster VBA Macros\").  Example: How to avoid the usage of the .Select statement Let\\'s take a look at the following simple macro Auto Fill Table:This function opens an input box that asks the user to specify a cell range. The function moves over all cells in the range. If it finds a cell that is not empty, it copies the cell content to the clipboard. The function pastes the clipboard content into every subsequent empty cell.Auto Fill Table uses the clipboard to copy the cell content. Therefore, the function needs to select each cell that is manipulated so that Excel knows which cell to copy from and into which cell it should paste. The recommended solution is shown in the following function Auto Fill Table2:Auto Fill Table2 differs in two important ways from its predecessor: Most importantly, it does not need to select a cell anymore. Instead, when a cell is found that is not empty, this cell is stored in the variable i Cell Master. Thereafter, whenever an empty cell is found, all the content of i Cell Master is copied into i Cell. It uses the Visual Basic language feature For Each … Next to visit every cell in the range. That is already an improvement to legibility.

In addition to the basic theme colors, the Power Point color palette offers five brightness levels, i.e., lighter tints and darker shades.Due to technical limitations in Power Point\\xa02007, think-cell cannot support theme color brightness levels in this version, i.e., shading is ignored and only basic theme colors are used. Therefore, font color in think-cell labels may differ from font color you use elsewhere in Power Point, and labels may even be invisible if the basic theme color happens to match the background color.The problem does not occur in Power Point\\xa02010 and later because Microsoft added programmatic access to color brightness. If a chart was created with Power Point\\xa02010 or later, editing the chart in Power Point\\xa02007 may therefore convert any of the five additional brightness levels to the basic theme color from which it was derived.Solution Do not use shades of theme colors if charts are edited in Power Point\\xa02007. You can apply the same color value by clicking on More Colors > Custom and specifying its RGB value.Due to the large number of problems in Power Point\\xa02007, think-cell recommends using a newer Power Point version.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

If you need to show think-cell charts in Microsoft Word or Excel you can: Copy/paste a picture or graphic of a chart into Microsoft Word [Excel] Copy/paste a picture or graphic of a whole Microsoft Power Point slide into Microsoft Word [Excel] Embed a Microsoft Power Point object into Microsoft Word [Excel] by using Microsoft\\'s Object Linking and Embedding technology (OLE) Solution 1 & 2: Copy/paste a chart or a whole Power Point slide In Power Point, select the chart or slide, and copy it with CTRL + C In Word [Excel], paste the chart or slide with: Home > Clipboard > Paste dropdown > Paste Special… > Picture (Enhanced Metafile) (Pasting as Picture (Enhanced Metafile) ensures that image quality is not degraded.) If you paste the whole slide, you may want to use the Crop feature in Word [Excel] to hide and possibly delete the parts you do not need.Known Issues: When pasting a chart, the background of labels on cluttered background or axis breaks may not be shown correctly in the pasted picture.For further information and a workaround:  This is due to the design of Office\\xa02007 and later. The Power Point fill type Slide background fill is unique to Power Point and is not converted into a different fill type or color when copying the shape into other Office programs. We asked Microsoft to reconsider and exhausted all possible avenues, but our design change request was finally rejected. Quoting the relevant part from Microsoft\\'s rejection letter, \"We have conducted an investigation into the cause of the problem. It appears that this behavior is by design as a Slide Background Fill behaves essentially like a No Fill. For instance, if a user had chosen a picture background for their shape rather than a solid fill, there should be no fill option when translated to Word.\" If your company has a Microsoft Office support contract and you want to contact Microsoft regarding this issue, you may refer to case number 114073011660776 or the design change request Office14#903613.

A new slide is created with all shapes having a white Solid fill instead of Background fill. Go to the new slide, copy the chart and paste it as described above. Please note that this workaround has to be executed for each affected slide. Solution 3: Embed Power Point objects In Power Point, select the slide, and copy it with CTRL + C In Word [Excel], paste the slide with: Home > Clipboard > Paste dropdown > Paste Special… > Microsoft Power Point Slide Object  Using this method it is possible to modify think-cell charts within the Microsoft Power Point Slide Object in Word or Excel afterwards. Right-click on the embedded slide: Slide Object > Open. We recommend to use Slide Object > Open instead of double-clicking the embedded slide or using Slide Object > Edit, since Edit caused issues when working with older Microsoft Office\\xa02013 versions. When using an Excel data link (see 22. Excel data links) to the think-cell chart on the embedded Power Point slide, any data changes will only be available in Power Point after opening the slide object.

Such changes may move labels to a different background, necessitating a font color update. This can also happen unsupervised during automated chart updates.think-cell chooses from two specific Power Point design theme colors: Power Point's default font color and a color of opposite brightness (Text/Background\\xa0Dark\\xa01 and Text/Background\\xa0Light\\xa01). Change these two colors to change the font color throughout the whole presentation, e.g., dark blue instead of black, or light gray instead of white.Make sure that one of the theme's Background Style options is selected in Power Point. This is required for Power Point to use the Text/Background theme colors correctly. When you convert an old presentation or template from a *.ppt/*.pot file format to the new *.pptx/*.potx formats, Power Point forgets to correctly set a Background Style.  In Power Point\\xa02007 and 2010: Design > Background > Background Styles. In Power Point\\xa02013 and later: Design > Variants > More > Background Styles. For further information on how to set a Background Style correctly, refer to KB0129. Some Power Point files are ambiguous in their use of design colors. think-cell then tries to deduce the desired font color from the file's available information. For details see Special cases further down on this page.Manual font color selection You may apply a manual font color choice to selected labels (see 6.5.2 Font color).think-cell's automatic font color selection in detail Which font color does think-cell use for label text?think-cell chooses between two colors for labels, a primary font color and an alternative font color. think-cell's primary font color is the color that Power Point uses as its default color for text.The second color, think-cell's alternative font color, should be a color of opposite brightness. Therefore, think-cell recommends that the color theme is set up in a consistent way, i.e., a light alternative color supplementing a dark primary color or vice versa. This is how Microsoft intended the Text/Background Light/Dark color pairs to work - compare the Power Point templates automatically installed with Office.\\xa0Light Background Styles (e.g., BG Style 1, 2)Dark Background Style(e.g., BG Style 3, 4)Primary text color Text/Background Dark 1Text/Background Light 1Alternative text color Text/Background Light 1Text/Background Dark 1For information on how to change these colors please refer to KB0105.Labels inside of think-cell shapes When a label is placed on a shape that is controlled by think-cell, typically a segment in a column/bar chart or an area in an area chart, the font color for this label is automatically chosen from think-cell's primary and alternative font colors to provide optimal contrast with the background.  When the luminance of the alternative color is similar to the primary color and the contrast therefore insufficient, think-cell uses either black or white for inverted labels to maximize the contrast from the background. Labels outside of think-cell shapes If a label is not placed on a shape that is controlled by think-cell then think-cell does not know the actual background the label is placed on. Therefore, the software uses the primary font color.  think-cell cannot know the actual label background because the color behind the label may not be the background color from the Power Point theme, but instead a different color set by a right-click on the slide background > Format Background. In this case the background may even be a gradient, a picture, a texture, or a pattern. The label may as well be placed on a custom Power Point shape or image. This also applies to boxed labels. Here, think-cell uses the theme's background color for the label background and the primary font color for the label text. How can I check think-cell's current font colors?To quickly check which colors think-cell currently uses for text and lines in charts, simply bring up a Power Point color palette.  Right-click on a textbox and open the Font color dropdown. Move the mouse pointer on top of the first two boxes of the palette as indicated in the screenshots. The second box shows think-cell's primary font color. The first box shows think-cell's alternative font color.   If the primary font color used by think-cell is not the text theme color, see Special cases further down. How can I adapt the font color to a background image? Apply a background image as explained in KB0129. Set think-cell's primary font color to have a high contrast with the background image and the alternative font color to a color of similar darkness as the image. Refer to KB0105. How can I achieve white labels on a dark background? Set a dark background as explained in KB0129. Set primary font color to white as explained in KB0105. Special cases Some Power Point versions may contain a bug leading to incorrect font colors Please see KB0206 for details and workarounds.The slide master's body text placeholder does not use the design theme's text color If a Power Point template is ambiguous in its use of the theme colors, in our experience the intended font color is most often the body text placeholder's color. think-cell therefore uses this for the primary font color. The alternative font color is unaffected and chosen as described above.If the body text placeholder uses more than one font color and the resulting font color in think-cell differs from your expectations, contact our support team.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

As of July 2017, Microsoft fixed the problem in Office\\xa0365 and Office\\xa02016. Office\\xa0365 and the Office\\xa02016\\xa0Click-to-Run editions received the fix with the update to Version 1706 (Build 8229.2073). The fix for the MSI-based edition of Office\\xa02016 was included in KB3203481.Explanation and workaround if your Office version is not fixedthink-cell tries to determine the correct font color based on the font colors your Power Point template provides. Power Point versions containing the bug tell think-cell incorrect values for the font color if some placeholders are missing on the slide master’s top level slide. This problem can be reproduced without think-cell.  Reproduction without think-cell The following macro inserts a new slide with a textbox showing the resulting font color values for each Text Style Level of your Power Point\\'s slide master. \"Text Style Level[1]\" shows the main font color provided by Power Point.

If some label backgrounds do not match the slide background, insert an axis break. If the axis break is NOT affected please refer to KB0123: Why do the labels in think-cell charts appear as white rectangles? Solutionthink-cell recommends the following ways to set a background which enables think-cell to work together with Power Point seamlessly. The best way is to set (or leave) the slide background settings on automatic (default), and only adjust the Power Point theme colors such that they provide a good reading contrast:  Power Point\\xa02010: View > Master Views > Slide Master > Edit Theme > Colors > Create New Theme Colors… Power Point\\xa0365, 2013, 2016, 2019: View > Master Views > Slide Master > Edit Theme > Colors > Customize Colors… Set Text/Background Dark 1 to a dark color you want for text and lines or your dark background Set Text/Background Light 1 to a light color you want for the default slide background or your text and lines in case you use a dark background For further information refer to KB0105: How can I change the default colors of charts created with think-cell?. Setting the slide background for the whole presentation Set the slide background of all slides (incl. slide masters and layouts). This will also reset the background fill of all slides to automatic.  Open the Slide Master: View > Master Views > Slide Masterand go to the Slide Master's top level slide. To enforce the change for all slides, first switch to a different background style:Background > Background Styles and choose, e.g., Style 2. Choose your preferred background: Case 1: To set a light solid background fill choose Style 1 (default) or Style 2   Case 2: To set a dark solid background fill choose Style 3 or Style 4   Case 1/2 b: To set a solid background fill for header and/or footer separately Set the Background Style for the whole slide as explained in Case 1 or Case 2. To color the background of the header and/or footer, insert a Power Point shape: Home > Drawing > Rectangle and format it as desired.   Case 3: To set a picture or texture, pattern, or gradient fill as background: Background > Background Styles > Format Background Choose your desired background > Apply to All > Close Note: If you are choosing a dark background, please first of all set a dark Background Style as explained in Case 2. Afterwards, apply your desired background. This ensures that a light color will be used for text and lines.   Close the Slide Master: Master > Close Master View Setting the slide background for an individual slide After setting up a background for the whole presentation as described above, set the background for an individual slide as follows:  Right-click on the slide > Format Background Choose your preferred background > Close Note: If the individual slide has a dark background and the rest of the presentation has a light background or vice versa, you need to associate this slide with an analogous Background Style first, so that Power Point and think-cell can adjust the font color accordingly: Select the slide Office 365, 2016, and 2013: Design > Variants > More > Background Styles Office 2010: Design > Background > Background Styles Right click on Style 4 (for dark backgrounds) or Style 1 (for light backgrounds) Apply To Selected Slides Afterwards, apply your desired background. This ensures that a light (or dark) color will be used for text and lines. Using a chart background You may have tried to simply place a solid rectangle behind the chart. Then, however, boxed labels and axis breaks do not match the chart background. This problem can be avoided by proceeding as follows    Open the Slide Master: View > Master Views > Slide Master Right click on the Slides tab > Insert Layout > right click on the new Layout > Rename Layout > type, e.g., Chart Background Format the slide background of the new Chart Background Layout the way you want the chart background to look: Right click on slide > Format Background… Insert a rectangle for the slide background (white in the screenshot), resize it so that it covers the whole slide, and then adjust the fill to what you want the background of your slide to look like, then send it to the back. Close the Slide Master: Master > Close Master View On each slide, where you want to place a chart: Right click on Slide > Layout > Choose your custom layout, e.g., Chart Background Insert a rectangle for the chart background (blue rectangle in the screenshot) and set the fill to Slide Background Fill. Explanationthink-cell only receives information about the current Background Style, but no information about the Format Background… settings. Therefore, setting a Background Style is required for Power Point and think-cell to use the Text/Background theme colors correctly (e.g., light font color on a dark background or vice versa dark font color on a light background) as explained in KB0100: How can I change the font color?.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

For instance, think-cell needs to update its internal information when you click the Align button on a selection of think-cell objects. Typically, when you click a button that is hooked by think-cell, think-cell does its own maintenance work and then forwards the call to Power Point which executes the same function as it normally would.The tooltip including the hint to the add-in that hooked the button is generated by some versions of Microsoft Office. There is no way for an add-in to change or suppress this hint. By way of the tooltip, Power Point informs the user that a certain function is being redirected to some add-in, which can be regarded as a security feature helping to avoid accidental execution of malicious software.Further Problems?If you experience problems with a certain Power Point function and you suspect that think-cell may be the culprit because it has hooked that function, you can quickly find out by following the instructions in KB0091.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

Toggle the value axis between absolute and percent representations. The results depend on the chart type. For details please refer to Adjusting the value axis type in the user manual. Convert a scatter chart into a bubble chart (and vice versa) simply by adding or removing the values in the datasheet\\'s \"Size\" column. For details please refer to 12. Scatter chart and bubble chart in the user manual. Switching between other chart types is best achieved by creating the new chart next to the existing one and copy-pasting the data from the old datasheet to the new one. Sometimes you may have to reinterpret the data. E.g., in a bubble chart each data point has three dimensions (x, y, and size), while in a column chart it has only one dimension (y).If you want to explore multiple ways of displaying the same data, we suggest you use an Excel data link (see 22. Excel data links). You can create as many charts as you want all linked to the same Excel data range. This way, when data changes all linked charts can be updated to reflect the change and you can easily compare the results.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

On your computer, so that you have the custom colors available in other (e.g., new) presentations. There is currently no official means to clear the custom colors list. While there is no way at all to remove custom colors from a presentation file, the part of the list that is stored on your computer (the part below the divider line) can in fact be cleared. However, be aware that you will lose some other settings, too, including your custom precisions list and possibly your license key (which you can re-enter on the next start of Power Point or Excel).  The custom-defined colors are stored in a file and get cleared when you remove the file.The following steps describe how to do this:  Open a new Windows Explorer window. Type %APPDATA%\\\\think-cell into the address field and press Enter. Note: This step might delete the license key from your system. Please ensure that you have a valid license at hand before you proceed.  Delete the settings.xml.

However, think-cell and most likely also other add-ins must access slides when the file is opened, and there is no way for an add-in to know that a file is corrupt.We filed a case with Microsoft, but so far Microsoft has not decided to fix it. If your company has a Microsoft Office Support contract and you want to contact Microsoft to ask for a fix, you may refer to Microsoft case number 115040112590053. The error can be reproduced without think-cell.  Reproduction without think-cell The error can be reproduced without think-cell if any code accesses the corrupt slides before the repair is finished. In the following reproduction, the Presentation Open event handler calls code accessing all slides when the file opens, i.e., before the repair. Open Power Point\\xa02013 or later with a new empty file. In Power Point, go to Insert > think-cell > Tools      > Deactivate think-cell. Press Alt + F11 to open Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. Add this code as a Class Module and name it c Event Class: Public With Events PPT Event As Application Private Sub Class_Initialize()     Msg Box \"Event Handler is now active.\" End Sub Private Sub PPT Event_Presentation Open(By Val pres As Presentation)     On Error Go To err Handle:          Debug.Print \"open file: \" & pres.Name     Dim i As Integer          For i = 1 To pres.Slides.Count         Debug.Print \"Slide \" & pres.Slides.Item(i).Slide Number; \" / \" _  \\t& pres.Slides.Count     Next i          Exit Sub      err Handle:     Debug.Print (\"VBA Error: \" & Err.Number & \" \" & Err.Description) & vb Cr End Sub Add this code as a Module: Dim c PPT Object As New c Event Class Sub Initialize_Eventhandler()     Set c PPT Object.PPT Event = Application     Debug.Print \"**** Event Handler active ****\" End Sub In the Power Point presentation window, press Alt + F8 to open the Macro window Run the Initialize_Eventhandler macro. Now open your corrupt Power Point file and try to repair it.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.think-cell.com/en/resources/kb/0122', 'image_urls': []}, page_content='Knowledge base    KB0122  With think-cell some Excel COM Automation calls fail Problem With think-cell installed, some Excel COM Automation calls fail. The HRESULT error code is 0x8001010A RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER. In Lotus Script, the error is Automation object error.COM servers have the ability to filter incoming calls using the I Message Filter mechanism. More specifically, if the I Message Filter::Handle In Coming Call implementation returns SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER, the client call returns with RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER.Excel uses this mechanism irrespective of think-cell. The presence of think-cell increases the frequency of RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER, which makes the problem more prevalent.One product known to show errors in these circumstances is the scripting engine of IBM Lotus Notes, Lotus Script.Solution In response to RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER, the caller must briefly wait and then repeat the call. Visual Basic for Applications has this handling built in, so it is arguably a bug if other Windows scripting environments that support COM, such as Lotus Script, do not do it.Outside of scripting environments, or if the scripting environment does not do it, callers must handle RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER themselves. COM makes this fairly easy because it can automatically repeat calls on behalf of the client if it is told to do so. The actual calling code can stay unchanged.To enable this behavior, the client must implement its own I Message Filter, with the method I Message Filter::Retry Rejected Call returning something other than -1 if the dw Reject Type parameter is SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER. Then, in each STA thread doing COM calls, it must use Co Register Message Filter to register an instance of this implementation with COM.As an example, here is a C++ ATL RAII implementation:  class C Handle Retry Later Base :   public C Com Object Root Ex<C Com Single Thread Model>,   public I Message Filter { protected:   C Com Ptr<I Message Filter> m_imessagefilter Old;   BEGIN_COM_MAP(C Handle Retry Later Base)     COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY(I Message Filter)   END_COM_MAP() public:   // I Message Filter implementation   DWORD STDMETHODCALLTYPE Handle In Coming Call(     /* [in] */ DWORD dw Call Type,     /* [in] */ HTASK htask Caller,     /* [in] */ DWORD dw Tick Count,     /* [in] */ LPINTERFACEINFO lp Interface Info   ) {     if( m_imessagefilter Old ) {       // pass on to old handler, no change in behavior       return m_imessagefilter Old->Handle In Coming Call(         dw Call Type,         htask Caller,         dw Tick Count,         lp Interface Info       );     } else {       // default behavior       return SERVERCALL_ISHANDLED;     }   }   DWORD STDMETHODCALLTYPE Retry Rejected Call(     /* [in] */ HTASK htask Callee,     /* [in] */ DWORD dw Tick Count,     /* [in] */ DWORD dw Reject Type   ) {     if( SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER==dw Reject Type ) {       // in a script, wait indefinitely for robustness under load       return 100;     } else if( m_imessagefilter Old ) {       // pass on to old handler, no change in behavior       return m_imessagefilter Old->Retry Rejected Call(         htask Callee,          dw Tick Count,         dw Reject Type );\\t\\t\\t     } else {       // default behavior       return (DWORD)-1;     }   }   DWORD STDMETHODCALLTYPE Message Pending(     /* [in] */ HTASK htask Callee,     /* [in] */ DWORD dw Tick Count,     /* [in] */ DWORD dw Pending Type   ) {     if( m_imessagefilter Old ) {       // pass on to old handler, no change in behavior       return m_imessagefilter Old->Message Pending(         htask Callee,         dw Tick Count,         dw Pending Type );     } else {       // default behavior       return PENDINGMSG_WAITDEFPROCESS;     }   } }; // Instantiate this class in your scope to enable robust I Message Filter. class C Handle Retry Later :   public C Handle Retry Later Base { public:   C Handle Retry Later() {     // set new handler and save old one     _ASSERT( m_dw Ref==0 );     HRESULT hr=Co Register Message Filter( this, &m_imessagefilter Old );     // m_imessagefilter Old may be nullptr if there is no     // filter previously installed     _ASSERT( SUCCEEDED(hr) );   }   ~C Handle Retry Later() {     // reset old handler     {       C Com Ptr<I Message Filter> i Message Filter;       HRESULT hr=Co Register Message Filter(         m_imessagefilter Old,         &i Message Filter );       _ASSERT( SUCCEEDED(hr) );       // make sure noone replaced our I Message Filter       _ASSERT( i Message Filter==static_cast<I Message Filter*>(this) );     } // i Message Filter is last release     _ASSERT( m_dw Ref==0 );   }   STDMETHOD_(ULONG, Add Ref)() throw() { #ifdef _DEBUG     return Internal Add Ref(); #else     return 0; #endif   }   STDMETHOD_(ULONG, Release)() throw() { #ifdef _DEBUG     return Internal Release(); #else     return 0; #endif   }   STDMETHOD(Query Interface)(REFIID iid, void ** ppv Object) throw() {     return _Internal Query Interface(iid, ppv Object);   } }; Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

Fail, displaying one or more errors such as those below.     Cause New Outlook for Windows does not yet support generating emails with an attachment. Instead, Windows uses classic Outlook. This problem also occurs without think-cell.  Reproduce the error without think-cell: Open a new or existing Power Point presentation. Go to File > Share > Email > Send as Attachment. Send as Attachment uses Power Point's built-in email sharing functionality via the Outlook API to generate a new email with the chosen presentation attached.

When you paste the data, you observe one of the following problems: You receive a message: Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data. Only empty cells are pasted. Your date or number format has been lost, e.g., 1/1/2012 turns into 40909 or $3.5 turns into 3.5. After pasting, percentage values are displayed incorrectly. In 100% charts, the chart layout may change. Cell colors do not appear in the chart although you checked the Use Datasheet Fill on Top option. These problems can also occur when you use think-cell\\'s Excel data links.Problem 1Any of the problems listed above can happen if the .xlsx workbook contains more than ~65490 cell styles. You can check the number of cell styles with the following VBA command in the Immediate Window:print Activeworkbook.Styles.Count  The steps to check this are in detail: Press Alt+F11 to open the VBA editor. Go to the Immediate Window. If it is not visible, you can display it by clicking on View > Immediate Window. Type the following command and press Enter print Activeworkbook.Styles.Count Solutions 1: Clean up affected workbooks Copy your worksheets into a new workbook  In Office 2013 and later copying worksheets between workbooks prevents the accumulation of unused cell styles by default: Select all sheets in your workbook: hold SHIFT and click on the first and last worksheet Right-click on the selection: Move or copy… > To book: (new book) and tick Create a copy > OK Save the new workbook under a new name In Office 2007 and 2010 copying a worksheet into a new workbook copies all unused cell styles. To prevent this, please activate the following Hotfix first:  If your Office version is fully updated, this Hotfix is probably already installed. However, you also must activate this fix either by using the Fix it solution provided by Microsoft or in the registry as explained in the following Microsoft articles: Microsoft Office\\xa02007: KB2553085 Microsoft Office\\xa02010: KB2598127, which was published in the Office\\xa02010 update for April 2012. If activating the Hotfix does not work, apply the update mentioned in section Resolution in the Microsoft articles above. Clean up your workbooks with a cleanup tool  Use the cleanup tool recommended by Microsoft in KB213904. Using the XL Styles Tool, click Get Excel File, tick Force all cell styles to \\'Normal\\', then click Process File. When Excel opens with the cleaned up file, save it under a new name.  Remove custom cell styles from your workbook using a VBA macro  Open the VBA editor with Alt+F11. Select your workbook and click on Insert > Module. Then paste one of the following macros and run it by pressing F5: Delete Custom Styles() removes all custom cell styles from your workbook. Sub Delete Custom Styles() Dim st As Style Dim i, i_cust As Long i_cust = 0 For i = (Active Workbook.Styles.Count) To 1 Step -1 \\tWith Active Workbook.Styles(i) \\t\\tIf .Built In = False Then \\t\\t\\tOn Error Resume Next \\t\\t\\t.Locked = False \\t\\t\\tOn Error Go To 0 \\t\\t\\tIf Not .Locked Then \\t\\t\\t\\t.Delete \\t\\t\\t\\ti_cust = i_cust + 1 \\t\\t\\tEnd If \\t\\tEnd If \\tEnd With \\tIf (i Mod 100) = 0 Then Debug.Print i Next Msg Box \"Styles deleted: \" & i_cust & \" styles\" & Chr(13) & \"Styles left: \" & Active Workbook.Styles.Count End Sub The best solution would be to prevent the pasting of unused cell styles, but requires Microsoft to fix a bug in Excel\\xa02007 and later. Up to now Microsoft has not considered the business impact high enough to provide this fix. If your company has a Microsoft Office Support contract and you want to contact Microsoft to ask for a fix, you may refer to Microsoft case number 113012810172527, 114021711190574 (Excel 2013).Explanation 1The file format used when pasting data into the think-cell datasheet or when transferring it over an Excel data link (Biff12/.xlsb file format) supports ~65490 cell styles. When transferring data from a .xlsx workbook with a greater number of cell styles into the think-cell datasheet, either formatting information is lost, or pasting is not possible.  Some .xlsx workbooks contain a large number (several ten thousands) of cell styles due to bugs and problematic code design in Excel. A contributing factor are also reporting tools that sometimes generate unnecessarily many cell styles. Under certain conditions also all unused cell styles are copied, when copying cells or worksheets between workbooks. Copying a worksheet into a new workbook with Excel\\xa02007 or 2010: Right-click on the worksheet tab > Move or copy… > To book: (new book) and tick Create a copy. Copy/pasting cells (even a single cell) into another workbook in a separate Excel process or into the internal datasheet of think-cell  To start a separate Excel process, right-click on the Excel symbol in the task bar and click on Microsoft Excel\\xa020…   In Excel 2013 and later, keep the ALT key pressed simultaneously to start a separate process. Confirm the Do you want to start a new instance of Excel? message with Yes. think-cell is affected because our datasheet is based on an Excel worksheet in a separate Excel process. Copying cells into a new workbook within the same Excel process does not copy unused cell styles. Problem 2It may be possible to at first successfully copy/paste data from an Excel workbook (.xlsx) into the internal datasheet of a think-cell chart, but any subsequent copy/paste attempts (even of an empty cell) into the same datasheet cause the message, Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data. In this case, the other problems mentioned in the Symptoms section above do not occur.This problem happens when copying data between separate Excel processes, if a custom table style of the same name exists in both the source file and the target file. Since the first copy/paste also copies any custom table styles, the subsequent copy/paste attempts fail. The problem can be reproduced without think-cell.  Reproduction without think-cell Open two Excel processes. If Excel is already open, and you create a new workbook with Ctrl+N, the second workbook is kept within the same Excel process. To start a separate Excel process, right-click on the Excel symbol in the task bar and click on Microsoft Excel 20…   In Excel\\xa02013 and later, keep the ALT key pressed simultaneously to start a separate process. Confirm the Do you want to start a new instance of Excel? message with Yes. In the workbook that is open in the first Excel process, go to Excel > Home > Styles > Format as Table > New Table Style … > OK. This will insert a new custom table style named \"Table Style 1\". Copy/paste a cell from the workbook containing \"Table Style 1\" to the other workbook in the second Excel process. This works the first time. Once again, copy/paste a cell from the workbook containing \"Table Style 1\" to the other workbook in the second Excel process. The second time this fails with the message, Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data. Solution 2 Excel\\xa02007 and earlier are not affected by this issue. In Excel\\xa02010, the problem still occurs as of November, 2015. If your company has a Microsoft Office Support contract and you want to contact Microsoft to ask for a fix, you may refer to Microsoft case number 113012810172527, 114021711190574 (Excel 2013). In the meantime, you can use the following workarounds: Paste the data into the think-cell datasheet as text: think-cell datasheet > Paste > More (the little triangle button next to the Paste button) > Paste Special … > Text > OK. Click the Clear the Formats of all Cells button in the internal datasheet of think-cell. This removes any custom table styles from the datasheet and subsequent paste commands will work at least once. Microsoft has fixed this issue for Excel\\xa02013. Please install either KB2881014 from the Microsoft Office updates on June 10, 2014, or the hotfix KB2881042.

If a think-cell label uses Align Right by default, e.g., category labels in bar charts, this happens when you insert such a chart.Explanation The problem only occurs if the text box includes a tab stop. If Power Point's body text placeholder on the slide master contains a tab stop, think-cell is affected because it follows the body text placeholder's text settings.The problem is caused by a bug in Power Point 2007 and later. Power Point\\xa02003 behaved correctly. We have filed a case with Microsoft, but a fix for current Power Point versions was denied. If you want to contact Microsoft Office Support and ask them to reconsider, you may refer to case number 114071111611362. The problem can be reproduced without think-cell.  Reproduction without think-cell Please perform the following steps: Start Power Point\\xa02016/2013/2010/2007 with a new empty file. Insert a rectangle with Home > Drawing > Rectangle. Type a line of text into the rectangle. The line should be shorter than the width of the rectangle. Make sure that the text color differs from the slide background color. Select a character in the text. Add a tab stop close to the right-hand side of the rectangle. Right-click the rectangle and remove the check mark from Format Shape > Text Options > Text Box > Wrap text in shape. Reduce the rectangle's horizontal width until the tab stop is outside of the rectangle. Click Home > Paragraph > Align Right. Solution As a workaround until Microsoft fixes this bug, do not use tab stops together with Power Point's Align Right button if the shape has Wrap text in shape set to off. This includes think-cell labels because think-cell needs to control text wrap more accurately than Wrap text in shape can achieve.If the tab stop is in Power Point's body text placeholder, you can fix the problem for all subsequently inserted think-cell labels: Open the Slide Master in Power Point: View > Master Views > Slide Master Go to the slide master's top level slide and remove any tab stops from the body text placeholder. You may have to increase the width of the body text placeholder in order to see the tab stop in Power Point's ruler. Click Power Point > Slide Master > Close > Close Master View. Delete and reinsert existing think-cell labels to fix them. To fix the problem for individual think-cell labels without changing Power Point's body text placeholder: Select the label. Note that you need to select think-cell's currently empty label frame, which is highlighted in orange when you move the mouse over it. You cannot select the misplaced text. Change the label's alignment setting in Power Point: Home > Paragraph > Align Left or Align Center You can do this for several labels at once.

My customers experience Office crashes when my add-in and another add-in (e.g., think-cell) are running.Solution This problem is often caused by subclassing with Native Window.Assign Handle / Native Window.Release Handle.Instead, follow Microsoft's recommendation to P/Invoke to Comctl32.dll's Set Window Subclass and Remove Window Subclass, as described on this Microsoft Doc page. To make this change to your project, you can replace Native Window by thinkcell.Subclassed Window.cs wherever Native Window is used for subclassing:Download Subclassed Window.cs Limitations: The original Native Window can also create windows, but this is rarely used in combination with subclassing in the same instance of Native Window. thinkcell.Subclassed Window is not thread-safe, but subclassing and message processing usually happen on the same thread.

Explanation Such errors in think-cell are caused by a programming error in another add-in. Our developers analyzed the issue in detail. In this case the issue is caused by the Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP) add-in. According to our analysis, hooking/unhooking issues cause this problem when multiple add-ins are available.  A hook is a mechanism by which a function can intercept events before they reach an application. The function can act on events and, in some cases, modify or discard them. For further details, please see KB0201. Other add-ins known to cause such issues are listed in KB0169.Solution We received the feedback from Microsoft that the AIP client is in maintenance mode. Microsoft does not recommend using the AIP add-in for Office, because, i.e., \"Add-ins are less stable because they can conflict with other add-ins that can result in Office apps hanging, crashing, or automatically disabling the add-in.\" Instead, Microsoft recommends using the Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) built-in labeling for Office apps.Workaround The problem seems to disappear when turning off the Microsoft AIP bar below the ribbon in Power Point and Excel. To turn it off, go to Home > Sensitivity > untick Show bar. In any case, please ask your internal IT for advice.Contact support In case you are still experiencing issues without the Microsoft AIP add-in, proceed as follows:                                  Please send us the think-cell log files.

In some cases, the issue may then lead to files being very slow to open, edit, and/or save—or potentially not being able to open them at all.This issue may arise under the following conditions: Files are (or were) saved in a Share Point location Files are (or were) encrypted via, e.g. Azure Information Protection Microsoft Information Protection Microsoft Purview Information Protection Access Restrictions Slides or content on slides contain Tags or Customer Data objects (think-cell and many other add-ins use Tags objects as prescribed by Microsoft) Copying affected slides or objects to other presentations can introduce the issue to additional files, even if they do not meet the above criteria.Solution Microsoft has released a fix for this issue, which at present is available in the latest publicly known updates for Microsoft 365. Older versions available under the Monthly Enterprise Channel and Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel may still be affected for the time being.A table of affected and fixed versions can be found below:Version First affected build Fix available in:220815601.20578**230116026.20002**2302*16130.207142303***2304***2305***2306*16529.201822307*16626.20000* - issue existed in initial release ** - No fix expected Note: while Microsoft\\'s fix prevents the issue from arising, it does not repair files that are already affected. There are however a few options available to clean affected files, which in combination with Microsoft\\'s fix, should resolve the issue:  Power Point\\'s built-in Document Inspector can be used to remove custom XML data from affected files. If using this tool, please ensure that only the option Custom XML data is used. Removing additional content types may have unintended consequences, including removing think-cell functionality from the document. If you are using think-cell 12, the 21.3 Clean up and sanitize tool offers a more convenient way to access this same functionality. Removing custom XML data in one of these two ways will not prevent it from accumulating again if you are using an unpatched version of Power Point, but can at least temporarily \"reset\" the issue. In the event that you have files that are so severely damaged that they cannot reliably be opened with Power Point, and thus neither Document Inspector nor think-cell\\'s Clean up tool can be used, or if the number of affected documents requires an automated solution, please contact our support team. We may be able to help. Analysis Our developers have analyzed the problem in detail. In cases that meet the conditions described above, opening a file that is stored on Share Point and is encrypted may cause Power Point to call this function in its code:PPT::File IO::Customer Data Xml Reader::De Serialize Customer Data From Encrypted Storage This function was newly added starting in the listed versions of Power Point. Files stored on Share Point contain certain custom XML data files used for Share Point\\'s File Management. When the code function is called, all contained custom XML files in the entire document are duplicated for every slide or object that contains a Tag or Customer Data. Continuing to work with affected files may lead to the continued accumulation of this junk data in the course of normal editing actions, as well.This issue can be reproduced without think-cell. For detailed reproduction steps, please click on:  Reproduction without think-cell: With think-cell inactive or temporarily removed, open a new blank Power Point presentation with no placeholder textboxes Insert one Power Point rectangle, e.g. via Insert > Illustrations > Shapes Open the VBA window (press Alt+F11) In the Immediate Window (you can activate it by pressing Ctrl+G if not present) type in the following, and then press Enter: Active Presentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1).Tags.Add \"Test\", \"Tag\" Close the VBA window In Power Point, select and duplicate the rectangle via Ctrl+D 30 times, so that 31 total rectangles exist (the reproduction will work with fewer shapes, though the file sizes will then vary accordingly) Save the presentation to a Share Point location The document should be approximately 54 KB in size once fully synced to Share Point. Now, go to the File tab of the Power Point ribbon, and select Info > Protect Presentation > Restrict Access > Restricted Access:    In the Permission dialog that appears, check the box Restrict permission to this presentation and click OK:    Save the document (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+S) and then close it completely Open the document again Remove the access restriction by again going to File > Info > Protect Presentation > Restrict Access, and this time select Unrestricted Access Save the document again, and then close it. The document should still be 54 KB, but has grown to approximately 195 KB in size. Reopen the document and repeat steps 8 through 13 The document should still be 54 KB, but has grown to approximately 5 MB in size. Examining the file structure (by e.g. copying the .pptx file and changing the file extension of the copy to .zip, and then extracting the archive) one would see that the number of item*.xml and item Props*.xml files contained within the custom Xml subfolder will go from 3 of each file type after syncing to Share Point, to 96 of each after the first repetition, and 2979 of each after the second repetition. There are additional steps and work flows that may lead to duplication of custom XML data as well, but this is the most straight-forward to demonstrate and has the most pronounced effect. Why think-cell is affectedthink-cell does not use custom XML data, but it does use Tags in each shape or object created via think-cell. As such, slides created with think-cell may contain a particularly high number of tagged shapes, resulting in extremely fast duplication of custom XML data due to this issue.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

With Power Point 2016 and later versions, the issue only occurs in Normal view. The Slide Show view is unaffected.Cause The behavior can be reproduced with plain Power Point charts inserted from Power Point > Insert > Illustrations > Chart. Insert several charts to make the behavior easy to spot.We filed a case with Microsoft. Unfortunately, Microsoft informed us that this behavior is by design and is not expected to change. Microsoft explained as follows: Embedded objects, e.g. charts, have to be checked by the document inspector for security issues. In the past, this check occurred upon opening of the presentation, leading to slow load times if a presentation contained many objects. Starting with Office 2016, the object security check happens on slide switch instead. This improves initial presentation load times at the expense of the preview images appearing on slide switch.

If the tcasr.exe is missing, opening the internal datasheet does not work anymore and sending an email via Send Slides… or Request Support… fails with an error message (Problem 2). Solution To fix the issue: Install the latest Windows Defender security intelligence update, e.g., Windows Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection updates > Check for updates Reinstall think-cell to restore missing files. The problem was fixed by Microsoft. It does not occur with the security intelligence version 1.355.1377.0 or later. To verify your security intelligence version, go to Windows Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Settings > About. The latest security intelligence update is available for download on Microsoft's website.Workaround If you cannot install the Windows Defender security intelligence update, you can alternatively uninstall your existing think-cell installation and reinstall it as administrator. The problem does not occur with per-machine installations.Contact support In case think-cell is installed as administrator or if you cannot find the Warning in the Event Viewer, Windows Defender is not causing the issue to occur.

At some point after working with the internal datasheet of think-cell, I receive a COMBASE.DLL STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION error message.   In some cases, the error message does not appear and a new Excel window (of the regular, stand-alone Excel application) starts up instead.Solution The problem will be resolved by installing the following Microsoft Windows updates.Note: In a previous version of this article, we communicated the third week of October 2022 as the expected release date for the initial wave of Windows updates, based on the information we had received from Microsoft. However, Microsoft eventually postponed this wave to November. The currently available information as of December 1, 2022, follows.For the Windows versions listed below, Microsoft published optional releases in November 2022 (i.e., the 11C release in Microsoft\\'s naming convention). Refer to Microsoft\\'s release information on November 15, 2022—KB5020030 (OS Builds 19042.2311, 19043.2311, 19044.2311, and 19045.2311) Preview Windows 10 v22H2 (Build 19045) Windows 10 v21H2 (Build 19044) Windows 10 v21H1 (Build 19043) Windows 10 v20H2 (Build 19042) For the following Windows versions, updates were originally expected for November, and we have not yet received updated information. However, January 2023 is most likely, as December updates are reserved for security issues. Windows 11 Windows Server 2022 Windows 10 v2004 For this Windows version, an update was originally expected for January 2023, and we have not received information of a change. Windows 10 v1809: 1B (standard relase, second Tuesday of January 2023) It is expected that Microsoft will subsequently move the optional \"C\" releases to standard \"B\" releases.If you still experience problems after installing the appropriate Windows update, please contact our support team.Reproduction Steps If you are not sure if you are experiencing this error or a similar one, try these reproduction steps:  Open Power Point Insert a think-cell stacked chart: Insert > think-cell > Elements > Stacked > click on slide to insert chart > internal datasheet opens (Excel process shown in Task Manager > (More Details) > Details) Close internal datasheet > Wait until Excel process closes in Task Manager > (More Details) > Details) (may take ~30s) > CRITICALWITHMSG COMBASE.DLL 10.0.18362.1645+0x1BEBBE: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION or a new Excel window starts up> After dismissing error message, Excel process is closed Analysis This issue only occured in affected Windows versions when think-cell and Sentinel One\\'s Sentinel Agent were enabled together. Our developers analyzed the issue in detail:  The crash occured in COMBASE.DLL within the C Ctx Chnl::On Call function. We investigated the problem in 64-bit COMBASE.DLL 10.0.19041.1202 and the following address offsets and symbol names are from this version.Most of the code in C Ctx Chnl::On Call appeared to be robust against the this->_p I Face Entry->_p ID member being null (e.g., C Std Wrapper::Is NA Wrapper was called from C Ctx Chnl::On Call and had code to handle this).If, however, the Is Call Tracing Enabled call in C Ctx Chnl::On Call returned true, the code attempted to access this->_p I Face Entry->_p ID->_oid.Data1 without checking whether this->_p I Face Entry->_p ID was null, and this resulted in an access violation (COMBASE.DLL!Imagebase+0x00000000001A77B0). Temporary workaround If you cannot update Windows to one of the fixed versions yet, your IT may try this workaround:  A think-cell customer received this workaround from Sentinel One before the fixed Windows versions were available. For further information concerning this workaround, contact your Sentinel One support and refer to ticket #652625. Get the Sentinel One passphrase for the machine Run CMD as administrator: cd \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Sentinel One\\\\Sentinel Agent <X.X.X.XXX\\\\>\" sentinelctl config agent.relinking.com false -k \"PASS PHRASE FROM STEP ONE\" sentinelctl config agent.relinking.com (the returned value should be: false) Wait 5 minutes and then reboot the machine.

When I click on the green or red border of my existing linked Excel datasheet, I cannot select it. The frame does not turn blue and the handles to resize the datasheet are not shown:   This problem does not occur when using an Excel file without SAP functionality.Solution The problem has been fixed in SAP AO version 2.8 SP4.Cause in previous SAP AO versions Our developers analyzed the issue in detail. This problem has been reported for SAP Business Objects Analysis (see SAP ticket 557711 / 2018) and SAP Business Explorer (see SAP ticket 1019869 / 2011). As SAP Business Explorer is in maintenance mode at SAP, a fix for SAP B Ex is not expected.  According to our analysis, hooking/unhooking issues cause this problem when multiple add-ins are available. A hook is a mechanism by which a function can intercept events before they reach an application. The function can act on events and, in some cases, modify or discard them. The technique used for hooking by SAP Business Objects Analysis can cause errors when several add-ins are present at the same time. For further details, please see KB0201.

(Invalid high surrogate character (0x XXXX). A high surrogate character must have a value from range (0x D800 - 0x DBFF).)Cause This is due to a bug in Excel\\xa02000 and Excel\\xa0XP that results in the generation of Excel files with corrupt metadata. The problem occurs when a string custom document property with a linked source is added to an Excel document and the source cannot be resolved. In later versions of Excel the document property value is set to something valid (e.g. an empty string). In Excel\\xa02000 and Excel XP, however, the value contains garbage and may cause the Office Share Point crawler to fail. The Excel documentation explicitly states that the document property value is set to a default value before being updated when the source is resolved, and so this behavior is an Excel\\xa02000 and Excel\\xa0XP bug.The problem can be reproduced using the following steps: Use the following link to download a very simple Excel file: Link Source Prop.xls. Load the file using Office\\xa02000 or Office\\xa0XP Excel, ensuring macros are active. Press Alt+F11 to open the macro window and run the Add Document Property routine. Go to File > Properties and select the Custom tab. The value associated with the newly added Test Property is garbage. Solutionthink-cell uses custom document properties and, after noticing this behavior, we altered our code to add our document properties with type boolean rather than string. Both Excel\\xa02000 and Excel\\xa0XP set the document property to a valid boolean value and this value remains valid if the link source cannot be resolved.Files created using think-cell 5.0 and higher use this workaround and should be successfully crawlable by Office Share Point.Please contact Microsoft Office Support directly for advice about repairing corrupt document property values in Excel\\xa02000 or Excel\\xa0XP generated files.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

At some point while working in Excel, I receive a CRITICALWITHMSG n/a: std::terminate() error message and Excel crashes.   Users reported that the problem happens in various situations, e.g. when trying to: upload data using Smart View connect to the Oracle environment input values by typing in a cell delete the content of an Oracle Smart View cell, e.g., by pressing BACKSPACE Analysis In our analysis, it appears Oracle is not handling certain exceptions in their code. This is not supported behavior and can lead to an Excel crash:  HSADDIN.DLL (which belongs to Smart View) calls Excel::Window::Points To Screen Pixels X inside a WM_TIMER callback, and this call fails fairly often with VBA_E_IGNORE. This HRESULT is wrapped into an _com_error exception by the COM call wrapper, but not handled and falls through into the Windows WM_TIMER dispatch mechanism. Letting exceptions escape application code is not allowed, so a crash is expected. By default, though, the WM_TIMER dispatch mechanism contains a catch-all __try __except block, which catches the exception and silences any consequences. More recently, Office 365 has a setting controlled by Microsoft called a feature gate named Microsoft.Office.App Host.Expose Timer Proc Seh, which makes Excel follow Microsoft's own advice and disable the catch-all __try __except block described above by calling the Win32 API function Set User Object Information W(..., UOI_TIMERPROC_EXCEPTION_SUPPRESSION, ...). This makes Excel crash when the exception occurs. We do not know when Microsoft enables this setting, but we have seen it enabled on machines where the error occurs. If think-cell is installed, it catches the exception by accident and shows an error message. It is fairly certain that all this is not intended by Oracle, and they simply forgot to handle VBA_E_IGNORE in their add-in. Solution Affected customers reported that updating to Oracle Smart View version 21.200 fixes the issue. If this does not help, please contact your Oracle Smart View support for further information.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

Some underlying chart bodies still work, but most functionality is not present (labels, arrows, Gantt chart,\\xa0…).This problem can occur, e.g., in the following situations: You are working together with a person using Open Office.org or Libre Office. Therefore, you save your Power Point presentation (.pptx or .ppt file) as Open Document Presentation (.odp file) to give the file to the other person. Later you reimport the file into Power Point. You open an .odp file and insert a think-cell chart. You save the file in .odp file format. Explanation In the Power Point object model, each Power Point.Shape has a Tags collection that allows to store extra information about objects. think-cell uses such tags to identify which shapes on the slide belong to think-cell (for details please refer to KB0073).Power Point does not export the tags into the .odp file format. The information that certain shapes are think-cell shapes is lost.You can check this yourself by using the following VBA macro that lists all shapes and their tags on the current slide:  Sub List_Tags()   Dim o Shape As Power Point.Shape   Dim str As String   Dim i As Integer   For Each o Shape In Active Window.View.Slide.Shapes     Debug.Print o Shape.Name & \"( \" & o Shape.Tags.Count & \" tags)\"     For i = 1 To o Shape.Tags.Count       Debug.Print \"    Tag(\" & i & \"): \" & _         \"Name: \" & o Shape.Tags.Name(i) & \", \" & _         \"Item:\" & o Shape.Tags.Item(i)     Next i   Next o Shape    End Sub To run the macro open the VBA editor with Alt+F11.

Solution 2: Disable defective third-party add-ins Defective third-party add-ins can prevent the activation of think-cell\\'s Elements menu because Microsoft Office does not isolate individual add-ins from each other. Acer ab Docs  The problem may be caused by Acer\\'s ab Docs add-in, which comes preinstalled on some Acer computer models as part of the Acer BYOC Apps (ab Apps) suite. At least with certain versions of ab Docs installed and activated, think-cell no longer receives Power Point\\'s application events. You may want to try if updating ab Docs resolves the issue. If you want to use think-cell together with ab Docs and updating ab Docs does not help, please contact the Acer support and open a service ticket with them. Our experience shows that vendors often do not act if we contact them directly, as we are not their customers. Please pass on our contact data and tell them that we are happy to provide a more detailed explanation of the issue as well as a test version of think-cell. SMART Board  The problem may be caused by Smart Technologies\\'s SMART Board add-in, which is installed with the SMART Product Drivers. Several customers reported it for SMART Product Drivers up to version 10.8.118.0. In our tests, the problem could not be reproduced with SMART Product Drivers version 12.6. If you want to use think-cell together with SMART Board, please update the SMART Product Drivers to the current version.

Our experience shows that vendors often do not act if we contact them directly, as we are not their customers. Please pass on our contact data and tell them that we are happy to provide a more detailed explanation of the issue as well as a test version of think-cell. Microsoft Office Genuine Advantage  The problem may be caused by still having Microsoft\\'s Office Genuine Advantage add-in installed and activated. As Microsoft explains, the Office Genuine Advantage program has been retired. The latest Microsoft Genuine Advantage Software works online without an Office add-in. You can disable the outdated add-in without any concern. How to disable other add-ins permanently Find the add-in by following the instructions on how to use tcdiag.exe in KB0091.

Sub Delete Custom Styles() Dim st As Style Dim i, i_cust As Long i_cust = 0 For i = (Active Workbook.Styles.Count) To 1 Step -1 \\tWith Active Workbook.Styles(i) \\t\\tIf .Built In = False Then \\t\\t\\tOn Error Resume Next \\t\\t\\t.Locked = False \\t\\t\\tOn Error Go To 0 \\t\\t\\tIf Not .Locked Then \\t\\t\\t\\t.Delete \\t\\t\\t\\ti_cust = i_cust + 1 \\t\\t\\tEnd If \\t\\tEnd If \\tEnd With \\tIf (i Mod 100) = 0 Then Debug.Print i Next Msg Box \"Styles deleted: \" & i_cust & \" styles\" & Chr(13) & \"Styles left: \" & Active Workbook.Styles.Count End Sub Remove_Styles() removes only unused custom cell styles from your workbook. It is similar to the macro above, however it may take very long to run. The macro was provided by the Microsoft Office Support. Option Explicit Dim st_array() As String Dim i_x As Long Sub Remove_Styles() Dim stname As String Dim ustname As String Dim uc As Range Dim retval As Boolean Dim ust As Style Dim sh As Worksheet i_x = 0 For Each sh In Active Workbook.Worksheets     For Each uc In sh.Used Range         stname = uc.Style.Name         retval = Check_Array(stname)         If retval = False Then         Re Dim Preserve st_array(i_x)         st_array(i_x) = stname         i_x = i_x + 1         End If     Next uc Next sh For Each ust In Active Workbook.Styles     If ust.Built In = False Then         ustname = ust.Name         retval = Delete_Styles(ustname)         On Error Resume Next         If retval = True Then ust.Delete         On Error Go To 0     End If Next ust End Sub Function Delete_Styles(stylename As String) As Boolean Delete_Styles = True Dim i_y As Long For i_y = 0 To i_x - 1     If st_array(i_y) = stylename Then Delete_Styles = False Next i_y End Function Function Check_Array(stylename As String) As Boolean Check_Array = False Dim i_y As Long For i_y = 0 To i_x - 1     If st_array(i_y) = stylename Then Check_Array = True Next i_y End Function The best solution would be to prevent the pasting of unused cell styles, but requires Microsoft to fix a bug in Excel\\xa02007 and later. Up to now Microsoft has not considered the business impact high enough to provide this fix. If your company has a Microsoft Office Support contract and you want to contact Microsoft to ask for a fix, you may refer to Microsoft case number 113012810172527.Explanation Some .xlsx workbooks contain a large number (several ten thousands) of cell styles due to bugs and problematic code design in Excel. A contributing factor are also reporting tools that sometimes generate unnecessarily many cell styles.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact'),\n",

If you double-click on an Microsoft Graph based chart, e.g., a think-cell stacked chart, the datasheet does not open, but you receive the message     and after clicking Edit Existing     If the file was not yet saved in Power Point\\xa02010, it can be opened in Power Point\\xa02007 with fully working think-cell functionality. Once it was saved in Power Point\\xa02010, all think-cell functionality will be lost permanently even when openened with Office\\xa02007.                                 Most likely this problem will appear with files you received by email, and the sender has installed a cleaning tool like Workshare Protect 7 or a compression tool like Zip Mail 11.  Zip Mail 11 offers \"on-the-fly native XML volume optimization\" for email attachments, which means that it decompresses the zip archives in .pptx files and then recompresses them with a better compression rate.  Workshare Protect 7 offers \"cleanup and removal of all hidden electronic information, such as metadata, notes, and hidden comments\" by unzipping, cleaning and then re-zipping zip archives in .pptx files. Due to a bug in Power Point\\xa02010, it does not open all valid .pptx files with embedded elements like charts or pictures correctly.Solution Microsoft has fixed this bug. Please install Office\\xa02010 updates for June 2012 or hotfix KB2687274.You can repair affected files (not yet saved without the hotfix) by opening and saving them in Power Point\\xa02010 after installing hotfix KB2687274. Attention: If an affected file has been saved in Power Point\\xa02010 without Hotfix KB2687274 once, the embedded objects will be permanently corrupted. If you have received the file by email, open it directly from the email again.Zip Mail has implemented a workaround to the Power Point bug, so that you don\\'t experience problems, when sending emails with Zip Mail to other Power Point\\xa02010 users without hotfix KB2687274. To activate the workaround, please update to Zipmail 11.1.3 or later. In the zmlnl.ini file, include a new parameter Zip Mail Fix PPTX Embedded Objects=1.Explanation Actually a .pptx file is a zip archive containing different elements like slides and style definitions saved in separate files and folders. The Power Point specifications (ECMA-376.2.C2, table C-2 and C-5) allow a range of different zip formats. Due to a regression bug in Power Point\\xa02010, Power Point refuses to open embedded objects, if they are tagged with a zip format other than the default format \\'Deflate - superfast\\' that Power Point uses.  If you are an IT specialist, you may want to check yourself which zip compression method is used for embeddings. To do this Rename the .pptx file into a .txt file and open it in a Hex editor (e.g., Notepad++ with Hex Edit-plugin). Search for \"ppt/embeddings/oleobject\" in ANSI mode, to find a local file header of the zip structure (Actually, the search string is the file name of a compressed embedded object). Go to the local file header signature \"50 4B 03 04\" (in Hex mode) just before this. Bytes are counted from here starting with 0. Multi-byte numbers are stored in little-endian notation, i.e., the lower byte is stored first.    Background: Byte 8-9 counted from the beginning of the header show the compression method (CM). \\'Deflate\\' refers to \"08 00\". Byte 6-7 contain general purpose bit flags (GPBF), 16 bits that contain various information: For compression type \\'Deflate\\', Bit 1 and 2 indicate the compression subtype. In .pptx files written by Power Point, Bit 1 = 1 and Bit 2= 1, the other bits equal 0, thus resulting in GPBF \"06 00\". How to determine, if a .pptx file may have been treated by compression or cleanup tools: Look at bytes 6-7 (GPBF) and 8-9 (CM). If these bytes are not   this indicates that the .pptx file was not compressed by Power Point, but a different program. Thus the .pptx file will be affected by the Power Point bug described in this article.  Cleaning and compression tools unzip zip-archives in .pptx files, and then may compress them in a different zip format. After this, the files are still in accordance with Power Point specifications and can be opened correctly in Office\\xa02007, cannot be opened correctly in Office\\xa02010.

This problem does not occur with current versions of Power Point.         When opening a .ppt file with Power Point\\xa02007 and clicking into a label, the correct label background is shown, but the incorrect background returns after saving and reopening the file.  Open an affected .ppt file in Power Point\\xa02007. Click into an affected label > the label background takes on the correct color. Save, close and reopen the file. The labels' background is white again (or has the background fill, respectively). After opening a .ppt file with Power Point\\xa02007 and clicking into a label, when the correct label background is shown, the Power Point user interface still shows the incorrect Slide background fill.  Open the affected .ppt file in Power Point\\xa02007 and click into an affected label, so that the labels take on the correct color. Deactivate think-cell. Check the label background by right-clicking into the label > Format Shape > Fill: it shows Slide background fill where it should show No fill.   .pptx files show the error only when opened in Power Point\\xa02003 and earlier, not when opened in Power Point\\xa02007. Solution Power Point\\xa02010 and 2013 The issue existed in Power Point\\xa02010 and 2013, but was fixed.  Install Microsoft's updates for Office. Update to a current think-cell version. Open the affected file, click into any label of each affected chart to trigger the correction and save the presentation. Power Point\\xa02007The issue cannot be completely mended within Power Point\\xa02007.Removing the affected labels and adding them anew fixes these labels. However, even new labels may be affected by this issue again.Saving the file as .pptx after clicking into the labels, fixes the problem on the surface. You can work within Power Point\\xa02007 and later without seeing corrupt labels. Opening the .pptx file in Power Point\\xa02003 or earlier, shows that the corruption has covertly remained.To avoid this problem in the future: Use the .pptx file format when working with Power Point\\xa02007. Avoid passing presentations from Power Point\\xa02007 to Power Point\\xa02003 and earlier. Power Point\\xa02003 or earlier Open the affected file, click into any label of each affected chart to trigger the correction, and save the presentation.Explanationthink-cell normally uses the No fill option for label backgrounds. If, however, the label is placed on top of lines or cluttered background, the Slide background fill option is used to ensure legibility. Due to an issue in Power Point\\xa02007, if a label background is switched programmatically from Slide background fill to No fill, the label becomes corrupted, which in specific situations leads to white background.Microsoft fixed the issue for Power Point\\xa02013 and 2010. There will be no fix for Power Point\\xa02007. The issue can be reproduced without think-cell when using Power Point\\xa02007.  Reproduction without think-cell Please perform the following steps: Deactivate think-cell: think-cell > Tools      > Deactivate think-cell Execute this macro on an empty slide in Power Point\\xa02007: Sub test()         Dim sld As Slide         Set sld = Active Window.View.Slide         Dim shp As Shape         Set shp = sld.Shapes.Add Shape(mso Shape Rectangle, 0, 0, 100, 100)         shp.Fill.Background         shp.Fill.Solid         shp.Fill.Fore Color.RGB = 255 End Sub A red rectangle appears in the top left corner.

For the documentation of think-cell style files please refer to our online user manual in C. Customizing think-cell. This knowledge base article describes our recommended setup for creating valid think-cell style files.Editing a think-cell style file In principle, any program that creates plain text files can be used as an editor. A think-cell style file should be created using a dedicated XML editor since it can check your style file for possible errors. Fix any indicated warnings or errors before you use the style file.On Windows We recommend to use the free Visual Studio from Microsoft (any version will do) since it offers the best XML editing experience we have seen so far.Visit Microsoft's download page, choose the free edition (Visual Studio Community) and run the installer. Select Visual Studio Community once again when prompted. Please contact your internal IT department if you have problems installing the software.Setting up Microsoft Visual Studio In the window that allows to choose the components for Visual Studio, click Individual components > Cloud, database, and server > Connectivity and publishing tools. Click Install. Go to Visual Studio > Tools > Options… On the left, go to the Text Editor category. Choose XML > Miscellaneous. Enable Automatically download DT Ds and schemas. Go to View > Error List. Now, if you move the mouse over highlighted errors, you will get a tooltip with a detailed explanation of the error.On Mac We have not found a completely satisfying, free editing solution for the Mac, but there are workable options.Free options The free online validator on the Free Formatter website worked well in our trials. It performs validation against the syntax definition (XML Schema) on our webserver. Under XML Input you can either paste the style file contents or upload it directly. It is not necessary to upload the schema, the schema location in the style file is interpreted automatically.Microsoft's Visual Studio Community for Mac does not support online validation against the syntax definition (XML Schema) at the time of writing. To enable validation, you must download the XML schema from the link on the second line of the think-cell style file example (https://schemas.think-cell.com/<BUILDNUMBER>/tcstyle.xsd). Be aware that the syntax definition may differ per build number and you must use the appropriate version for your style file. We recommend always using the current version of think-cell, the style file examples that come with it, and the .xsd file referenced in these examples. Make sure to enable the Error View.Purchase options Of course, good editors for the Mac are offered for purchase. Examples include BB Edit and Xmplify. BB Edit offers a free version, but the XML validation seems to be available only in the paid version. For Xmplify, a free trial version is available at the time of writing and it worked perfectly in our trials: just open the think-cell style file. The online validation as well as the error checking window pane should work automatically without any setup work.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

In most cases, this is the expected behavior of Power Point. However, unexpected changes may occur when copying between Power Point's outdated ppt file format (default until Office\\xa02003) and the modern pptx file format of Power Point\\xa02007 and later versions.Copying between modern pptx files The font type changes if the text uses theme fonts and the theme fonts of source and destination files are different. This is the expected behavior.  Modern Power Point templates are based on Office document themes, which also define the theme fonts.  Check the Power Point font menu to see if a given text box uses a theme font. Theme fonts are listed in the separate Theme Fonts section of the menu, and (Headings) or (Body) is appended to the font name. The font type used in think-cell labels is taken from the body text placeholder on the slide master of the Power Point presentation or template. Use Power Point's paste options to control whether theme fonts are replaced. Use Destination Theme applies the theme font (and other theme settings) of the file you paste into. This is the default choice. Keep Source Formatting keeps the original font and other theme settings. To achieve this, Power Point implicitly copies the slide master of the source file to the destination file. How to choose Keep Source Formatting depends on the Office version.  Office\\xa02010 and later: Choose the paste option from Home > Clipboard > Paste Options (the little arrow below the Paste button).   Alternatively, use the Smart Tag that appears next to the pasted slide.   Office\\xa02007: Use the Smart Tag that appears next to the pasted slide.   Copying between outdated ppt and modern pptx files The font type and the font size may change unexpectedly. The problem does not happen with all ppt files, but if it does it is caused by Power Point and can be reproduced without think-cell.    Insert a text box with sample text into the original presentation. Copy it and paste it into the destination presentation. From the smart tag that appears after pasting, you can choose the following options: Paste Option: 'Keep Source Formatting' Office\\xa02007: Even though you chose Keep Source Formatting, the font type may change to the destination's theme font and the size may change. This is a bug in Office\\xa02007 and will not be fixed by Microsoft. Office\\xa02010 and later: This works as expected. If the font changes when using Office\\xa02010, this is most likely due to a bug that has since been fixed by Microsoft. Install Microsoft's automatic updates for Office\\xa02010 or at least KB2598346. Paste Option: 'Use Destination Theme' Office\\xa02007 and later: The pasted text box has a font size that is retrieved from the default Power Point text style of the destination presentation. This default text style's formatting options are not the same as for the Default Text Box and Default Shape the Master Text Style in the Text Placeholder on the Slide Master. Solutions if copying between outdated ppt and modern pptx files has unexpected results Paste Option: 'Keep Source Formatting' Office\\xa02007: Update to Office\\xa02010 or later. Microsoft does not publish fixes for Office\\xa02007 any more (except for security updates). Many issues remain which are fixed only in more recent versions. Paste Option: 'Use Destination Theme' Office\\xa02007 and later: The font size is determined by the default Power Point text style, which, to our knowledge and according to the information we received from Microsoft, cannot be accessed in the Power Point user interface. However, you can use VBA macros to display and change the font size of all indent levels of the default text style in the destination file. Open the VBA editor with Alt+F11. Select your workbook and click on Insert > New module. Then paste one of the following macros and run it by clicking Run Macro or by pressing F5. To display the Power Point default text style's font size (for all indent levels):  Sub Display Default Text Size()   Dim lvl As Text Style Level   For Each lvl In Active Presentation.Slide Master.Text Styles(pp Default Style).Levels     Debug.Print lvl.Font.Size    Next End Sub To set the Power Point default text style's font size (for all indent levels): Sub Adjust Default Text Size()   Dim lvl As Text Style Level   For Each lvl In Active Presentation.Slide Master.Text Styles(pp Default Style).Levels     lvl.Font.Size = 14   Next End Sub Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\"),\n",

For example, shapes that are invisible on the screen in Color mode (e.g., because their fill and outline match the background) may be visible on the printout if Grayscale or Pure Black and White printing is selected. On the other hand, a shape with a fill color that is different from background may be invisible on a grayscale printout because its grayscale value and that of its background coincide.Some Power Point object types have limited Grayscale and Pure Black and White support.Solution Review the settings in Color/Grayscale. If the printout differs, make the settings in View > Color/Grayscale and Print > Color/Grayscale match.For details and a subset of the known limitations please see Microsoft's Power Point documentation. The limitations can be reproduced with plain Office charts and we filed a case with Microsoft. If your company has a Microsoft Office Support contract and you want to contact Microsoft to ask for a fix, you may refer to Microsoft case number 117110617101802.Share Email Facebook Linked In Twitter XING Products Why think-cell? think-cell Suite Continuous improvement Customer references Case study Ask Brian Order New customer Add users Renew licenses Find a reseller Academic program Startup program Download Existing customer Free trial Resources Support Video tutorials Tips and tricks User manual Knowledge base think-cell academy Webinars Content hub Career C++ Developer (f/m/d) All job offers Talks and publications Events Developer blog Company About us News Contact\")]"
